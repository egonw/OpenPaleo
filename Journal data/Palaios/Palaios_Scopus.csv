Defensive morphological traits are thought to improve prey survivorship, and knowing which traits aid survivorship is critical to understanding predator-prey dynamics and their impact on community composition. Paleontological studies that use optimal foraging theory and single species experiments suggest that shell size and thickness are traits that affect the outcome of mollusk drilling predation. We analyzed the effectiveness of these morphological traits using a tropical molluscan assemblage from the One Tree Reef lagoon (southern Great Barrier Reef, Australia). Shell mass, shape, thickness, and predation frequency were measured in five bivalve species (n=804) constituting 80% of the predators' diet. Multiple regression determined that shell mass, shell thickness, and the interaction between the two were important predictors of predation. Drilling was more likely in thinner and larger individuals. However, support for the model that included species identity was markedly stronger, indicating that the morphological traits measured are not general predictors of predation across the five prey species we studied. That is, trait-only models are inadequate for explaining predatorprey dynamics at the community level. Alternatively, active behavioral defenses related to infaunality (like burrowing) appear to be stronger drivers of morphology in this system. Care should be taken when extrapolating results from experiments to communities or large temporal scales, as species with similar traits may not necessarily elicit the same response from predators.",,bivalve; coastal lagoon; community composition; community response; defense mechanism; morphology; predation; predator-prey interaction; prediction; Australia; Coral Sea; Great Barrier Reef; One Tree Island; Queensland; Bivalvia,,,,,,,"Aberhan, M., Guild-structure and evolution of Mesozoic benthic shelf communities (1994) PALAIOS, 9, pp. 516-545; Aberhan, M., Kiessling, W., Persistent ecological shifts in marine molluscan assemblages across the end-Cretaceous mass extinction (2015) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 112, pp. 7207-7212; Aberhan, M., Kiessling, W., Fursich, F.T., Testing the role of biological interactions in the evolution of mid-Mesozoic marine benthic ecosystems (2006) Paleobiology, 32, pp. 259-277; Allen, A.P., Brown, J.H., Gillooly, J.F., Global biodiversity, biochemical kinetics, and the energetic-equivalence rule (2002) Science, 297, pp. 1545-1548; Anderson, L.C., Naticid gastropod predation on corbulid bivalves: Effects of physical factors, morphological features, and statistical artifacts (1992) PALAIOS, 7, pp. 602-620; Anderson, L.C., Geary, D.H., Nehm, R.H., Allmon, W.D., A comparative study of naticid gastropod predation on Varicorbula caloosae and Chione cancellata, Plio-Pleistocene of Florida, USA (1991) Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, 85, pp. 29-46; Berke, S.K., Jablonski, D., Krug, A.Z., Roy, K., Tomasovych, A., Beyond Bergmann's rule: Size-latitude relationships in marine Bivalvia world-wide (2013) Global Ecology and Biogeography, 2, pp. 173-183; Blackburn, T.M., Gaston, K.J., Loder, N., Geographic gradients in body size: A clarification of Bergmann's rule (1999) Diversity and Distributions, 5, pp. 165-174; Boggs, C.H., Rice, J.A., Kitchell, J.A., Kitchell, J.F., Predation at a snail's pace: What's time to a gastropod?

The demographics are consistent with an extant elephant herd that is lacking only infants, and the generally accepted cause of death is a catastrophic flood and rapid burial based primarily on fossil articulation and associations with an ancient river channel and aquatic fauna. Herein we present new ichnological evidence of post-mortem biogenic bone modification contrary to a flood scenario with rapid burial. Traces on bone include branching furrows (Corrosichnia type), paired grooves (Machichnus regularis and M. bohemicus), arcuate grooves that penetrate the cortical material (Brutalichnus brutalis), roughly triangular punctures with jagged margins (Nihilichnus nihilicus), and hemispherical borings (Cubiculum isp.). The branching furrows are interpreted as root-dissolution features, whereas the remaining suite of traces demonstrate scavenging of the mammoths by rodents, carnivores, and hide beetles during a period of dry-decay and prolonged subaerial exposure. We propose that a drought scenario is a more plausible kill mechanism for this particular assemblage because: (1) a diminishing watering hole concentrating the local fauna explains the high taxonomic diversity; (2) migration to a distant water source explains the absence of M. columbi calves; and (3) a drought provides a parsimonious explanation for the site history in light of new observations regarding vertebrate and invertebrate scavenging. Under this scenario, the mammoths of WMNM represent at least one social group that perished during an anomalously dry season.",,bone; catastrophic event; cause of death; demographic history; flood; fossil record; ichnology; mammoth; paleoecology; river channel; scavenging (feeding); trace fossil; water resource; Texas; United States; Waco; Dermestes maculatus; Invertebrata; Mammuthus columbi; Rodentia; Vertebrata,,,,,,,"Andrews, P., Fernandez-Jalvo, Y., Surface modifications of the Sima de los Huesos fossil humans (1997) Journal of Human Evolution, 33, pp. 191-217; Bader, K.S., Hasiotis, S.T., Martin, L.D., Application of forensic science techniques to trace fossils on dinosaur bones from a quarry in the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation, Northeastern Wyoming (2009) PALAIOS, 24, pp. 140-158; Barnes, V.E., (1979) Geologic Atlas of Texas: Waco Sheet, , Bureau of Economic Geology, The University of Texas, Austin; Behrensmeyer, A.K., Taphonomic and ecologic information from bone weathering (1978) Paleobiology, 4, pp. 150-162; Behrensmeyer, A.K., Gordon, K.D., Yanagi, G.D., Trampling as a cause of bone surface damage and pseudo-cutmarks (1986) Nature, 319, pp. 768-771; Blackwell, L.R., Parkinson, A.H., Roberts, E.M., D'errico, F., Huchet, J., Criteria for identifying bone modification by termites in the fossil record (2012) Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, 338, pp. 72-87; Bongino, J.D., (2007) Late Quaternary History of the Waco Mammoth Site: Environmental Reconstruction and Determining the Cause of Death, 136p. , Unpublished M.S.

Lake Hamoun is located at the border of Iran and Afghanistan where inflowing rivers originate from the drainage basins of SW Hindu Kush Mountains and westernmost Himalaya. The lake has experienced a complex hydrological history during the late Quaternary due to climatic changes. Geochemical, sedimentological, and paleontological proxies as well as geomorphological data were used to investigate environmental changes of the lake. The results demonstrate that since the late glacial, the basin has directly and/or indirectly received its moisture from various climatic systems. During the early Holocene, both the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) and the mid-latitude westerlies (MLW) intensified and consequently the basin received higher precipitation. This interpretation is supported by higher content of total organic matter (mean: 8.2%), finer-grained sediments with low δ18O values (mean: -3.5%), as well as rich fossil content. Lower organic matter content (< 5%), higher magnetic susceptibility values (5.8-10×10-4 SI unit), and coarser-grained sediments with no shell fragments support the dominance of an arid environment during the early-mid Holocene. The results of stable isotopes suggest weakening of ISM and intensification of MLW during the mid-late Holocene in the study area, when Bronze Age civilizations emerged in the Sistan Basin. In the late Holocene, lake levels experienced more severe fluctuations due to variations in the MLW. Shifts in settlement areas seen in the archaeological record may thus have been a response to climatic changes.",,arid environment; Bronze Age; drainage basin; environmental impact; fossil record; Holocene; human settlement; last deglaciation; magnetic susceptibility; organic matter; paleoclimate; paleolimnology; Afghanistan; Himalayas; Hindu Kush; Iran; Sistan Basin,,,,,,,"Ahlers, R., Brandimarte, L., Kleemans, I., Sadat, S.H., Ambitious development on fragile foundations: Criticalities of current large dam construction in Afghanistan (2014) Geoforum, 54, pp. 49-58; Alizadeh-Choobari, O., Zawar-Reza, P., Sturman, A., The ""wind of 120 days"" and dust storm activity over the Sistan Basin (2014) Atmospheric Research, 143, pp. 328-341; Anad on, P., Moscariello, A., Rodŕiguez-Lázaro, J., Filippi, M., Holocene environmental changes of Lake Geneva (Lac Ĺeman) from stable isotopes (d13C, d18O) and trace element records of ostracod and gastropod carbonates (2006) Journal of Paleolimnology, 35, pp. 593-616; Annandale, N., Prashad, B., The Mollusca fauna of the inland waters of Baluchistan and of Seistan (1919) Records of the Indian Museum, 18, pp. 18-62; Araguás-Araguás, L., Froehlich, K., Rozanski, K., Stable isotope composition of precipitation over southeast Asia (1998) Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres (1984-2012), 103, pp. 28721-28742; Arz, H.W., Lamy, F., Pätzold, J., Müller, P.J., Prins, M., Mediterranean moisture source for an early Holocene humid period in the northern Red Sea (2003) Science, 300, pp. 118-121; Ball, W., (1982) Archaeological Gazetteer of Afghanistan: Catalogue des Sites Archeologiques D'Afghanistan, sur les Editions Recherches Civilisations, pp. 55-57. , Paris, 2 vols., Asie Centrale; Barlow, M., Cullen, H., Lyon, B., Drought in central and southwest Asia: La Niña, the warm pool, and Indian Ocean precipitation (2002) Journal of Climate, 15, pp. 697-700; Berger, A., Loutre, M.-F., Insolation values for the climate of the last 10 million years (1991) Quaternary Science Reviews, 10, pp. 297-317; Bond, G., Showers, W., Cheseby, M., Lotti, R., Almasi, P., Priore, P., Cullen, H., Bonani, G., A pervasive millennial-scale cycle in North Atlantic Holocene and glacial climates (1997) Science, 278, pp. 1257-1266; Bottema, S., A late Quaternary pollen diagram from Lake Urmia (northwestern Iran) (1986) Review of Palaeobotany and Palynology, 47, pp. 241-261; Bradbury, J.P., Dean, W.E., Anderson, R.Y., Holocene climatic and limnologic history of the north-central United States as recorded in the varved sediments of Elk Lake, Minnesota: A synthesis (1993) Geological Society of America Special Papers, 276, pp. 309-328; Charts, M.S.C., (2000) Revised Washable, , edition: Gretag Macbeth, New Windsor, NY; Chen, F., Holmes, J., Wünnemann, B., Yu, Z., Holocene climate variability in arid Asia: Nature and mechanisms (2009) Quaternary International, 194, pp. 1-5; Chen, F., Yu, Z., Yang, M., Ito, E., Wang, S., Madsen, D.B., Huang, X., Wünnemann, B., Holocene moisture evolution in arid central Asia and its out-of-phase relationship with Asian monsoon history (2008) Quaternary Science Reviews, 27, pp. 351-364; Costantini, L., Tosi, M., The environment of Southern Sistan in the third millenium BC, and its exploitation by the proto-urban Hilmand civilization (1978) The Environmental History of the Near and Middle East since the Last Ice Age, pp. 165-183. , W.C.

Five localities within the Puerto Madryn Formation (Valdes Peninsula, Chubut Province, Argentina) were investigated in order to assess the effects of distal volcanic ash deposition on shallow marine communities during the middle Miocene (Tortonian). All five localities expose shallow marine deposits, and contain invertebrate fossils including abundant decapod crustaceans and bivalve mollusks. Sediments and fossils were analyzed using multiple geochemical and visual methods including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), petrographic microscopy, and reflected light microscopy. The sediments were found to uniformly contain a high percentage of very fine volcanic ash. Three previously unstudied localities including two paleosurfaces and a stratigraphic section which record a single mass mortality event were documented. Two paleosurfaces previously described by three of the authors (SC, RMF, CES) were revisited in order to assess the cause of death of the fossil assemblages at those sites. Although the field locality lies a minimum distance of 650 km from the Andean volcanic front, the effects of ash were nonetheless catastrophic; the crustaceans are interpreted to have been the victims of acute respiratory failure due to the introduction of volcanic ash to the branchial chamber.",,bivalve; cause of death; crustacean; deposition; fossil record; geochemical method; invertebrate; marine environment; mass mortality; Miocene; paleoecology; shallow water; volcanic ash; Argentina; Chubut; Patagonia; Puerto Madryn; Valdes Peninsula; Bivalvia; Crustacea; Invertebrata; Mollusca,,,,,,,"Ahmad, F.A., Chaplin, A.E., Anaerobic metabolism of bivalve molluscs during exposure to air (1984) Biochemical Systematics and Ecology, 12, pp. 85-88; Alvarez, M., Weiler, N.E., Hernández, M.A., Ligando a geomorfologia a hidrodinamica: um estudo de caso na Peńinsula Valdes, Pataǵonia, Argentina (2009) Hydrogeology Journal, 18, pp. 473-486; Artzner, D.G., (1974) Palynology of A Volcanic Ash in the Fox Hills Formation: (Maestrichtian) of Emmons, Morton, and Sioux Counties, North Dakota, 122p. , Unpublished M.S. thesis, Kent State University, Kent; Arudpragasam, K.D., Naylor, E., Gill ventilation and the role of reversed respiratory currents in Carcinus maenas (L.)

The investigation of taphonomy of the mammalian remains from the Arikareean-aged Cabbage Patch beds of western Montana reported here used both sedimentological evidence and characteristics of the preservation of the fossil specimens to test two hypotheses regarding their preservation pattern: (1) the pattern of faunal change through the section is not a product of differences in the preservation of fossils and (2) the taphonomic characteristics of fossil specimens are linked to the environments in which they were preserved. The interpretation of the sedimentological data, combined with the analyses of the taphonomic filtering of mammalian fossils, suggests that the attritional accumulation of fossils in floodplain settings was the result of predator activity, attrition, and local reworking by fluvial processes. The fossils from these deposits experienced little transport. Moreover, despite complexities in the dataset, select specimen characteristics, including size, shape, and surface modifications, can be linked to the depositional environments determined from sedimentological data. The fossils recovered from a high energy deposit of the lower Cabbage Patch are significantly different from those found in low energy deposits. These low depositional energy fossil assemblages appear to be sufficiently taphonomically similar to be used in faunal analyses despite a change in postmortem filtering through the section.

Here we used radiocarbon-calibrated amino acid racemization ages from 173 Fulvia tenuicostata shells collected from Sydney Harbour (NSW, Australia) to quantify time-averaging in surficial and excavated death assemblages. A novel approach to estimating the total age-estimate variability of a collection of specimens is presented that integrates the age-estimation error associated with the AAR calibration model and the effect of time-averaging variability on the age distribution. Fulvia collected from a single 1.6-m deep excavation were used to quantify changes in time-averaging with burial depth. Fulvia collected from surficial death assemblages at six sites were used to quantify spatial variation in time-averaging. The median shell age increased from 150 yr to 4230 yr and time-averaging from 40 yr to 960 yr with increased burial depth. While four sites contained surface shell assemblages with median ages of 150 yr and time-averaging of 40 yr, two sites had death assemblages with older median ages and time-averaging > 1900 yr. A decline in the abundance of Fulvia in the post-colonial period is likely responsible for the rarity of very young shells in the surface death assemblages, while local factors such as dredging and other human activities are likely responsible for the total age-estimate variability in the two highly time-averaged surface collections. These analyses provide a geochronological context for assessing ecological changes in the harbor's benthic communities since colonization and offer an important perspective on the formation of Holocene fossil deposits.

The tracks are attributable to Anomoepus, and although mostly tridactyl, they include a few examples with characteristic tetradactyl morphology. Although considered a characteristic index ichnotaxon of a footprint-based Lower Jurassic biochron, Anomoepus has often been overlooked in assemblages dominated by theropod tracks. This is one of the earliest Anomoepus records from the Jurassic of China, and the fifth report of Anomoepus from China at all. To date, four reports represent sites inferred to be Lower or Middle Jurassic in age, with one dated as Upper Jurassic. It is an important component of Early Jurassic ichnofaunas because it points to the presence of ornithischian trackmakers, which are often rare or missing in the local skeletal faunas (Lufengosaurus faunas).",,dinosaur; footprint; fossil assemblage; fossil record; ichnofacies; ichnology; Jurassic; morphology; paleoenvironment; skeletal remains; trace fossil; trackway; China; Yunnan; Anomoepus; Ornithischia; Theropoda,,,,,,,"Barrett, P.M., Butler, R.J., Knoll, F., Small-bodied ornithischian dinosaurs from the Middle Jurassic of Sichuan, China (2005) Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, 25, pp. 823-834; Bien, M.N., 'Red Beds' of Yunnan (1941) Bulletin of the Geological Society of China, 21, pp. 159-198; D'Alessandro, A., Bromley, R.G., Trace fossils in Pleistocene sandy deposits from Gravina area, Italy (1986) Revista Italiana di Paleontologia e Stratigrafia, 92, pp. 67-102; Dong, Z., Tang, Z., New ornithopod genus from the Middle Jurassic of Sichuan Basin, China (1983) Vertebrata PalAsiatica, 21, pp. 168-171; Emmons, E., (1844) The Taconic System: Based on Observations in New York, Massachusetts, Maine, Vermont and Rhode Island, 68p. , Carrol and Cook, Albany; Falkingham, P.L., Gatesy, S.M., The birth of a dinosaur footprint: Subsurface 3D motion reconstruction and discrete element simulation reveal track ontogeny (2014) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 111, pp. 18279-18284; Fang, X.S., Pang, Q.J., Lu, L.W., Zhang, Z.X., Pan, S.G., Wang, Y.M., Li, X.K., Cheng, Z.W., Lower, Middle, and Upper Jurassic subdivision in the Lufeng region, Yunnan Province (2000) Proceedings of the Third National Stratigraphical Congress of China, Editorial Committee of Proceedings of the Third National Stratigraphical Congress of China, pp. 208-214. , Geological Publishing House, Beijing; Gatesy, S.M., Middleton, K.M., Jenkins, F.A., Shubin, N.H., Three-dimensional preservation of foot movements in Triassic theropod dinosaurs (1999) Nature, 399, pp. 141-144; Gierliński, G., Pienkowski, G., Dinosaur track assemblages from the Hettangian of Poland (1999) Geological Quarterly, 43, pp. 329-346; Gierliński, G., Pienkowski, G., Niedzwiedzki, G., Tetrapod track assemblage in the Hettangian of Soltykow (2004) Poland, and Its Paleoenvironmental Background: Ichnos, 11, pp. 195-213; Hall, J., (1847) Paleontology of New York, Volume I, Containing Description of the Organic Remains of the Lower Middle Division of the New York System (Equivalent of the Lower Silurian Rocks of Europe), 338p. , C. van Benthuysen, Albany; Haubold, H., (1984) Saurierfahrten, 231p. , Wittenberg Lutherstadt, A.

Data collected for this study include bed-scale averaged bioturbation intensity, size-diversity index, and ichnogenera abundances. These data were used to assign each bed into one of 10 clusters using K-Means clustering. The clusters were ranked according to interpreted intensity of cumulative depositional ecologic stress. Time-series, where each silty-mudstone bed represents a time-step with a corresponding ecologic stress value, were constructed from the interpreted ecologic stress cluster analysis results. To identify and interpret spatial and temporal variation in the ichnological time-series, two time-series analysis methods were employed: dynamic time-warping and continuous wavelet transforms. Dynamic time-warping is used as a descriptor of the spatial similarity between ecologic stresses, and continuous wavelet transforms are used to interpret cyclical patterns in the ichnological time-series. Spatially, the variability and cyclicity observed in the ecologic stress time-series can be linked to estuary scale stresses and more localized stresses (i.e., bar-form scale depositional stress). This is reflected by the relatively similar periodicities observed in the ecologic stress time-series. Temporally, cyclical ecologic stress patterns occur somewhat predictably in periods of approximately four, or multiples of four, which are consistent with El Nino cyclicity.

Specialized software, PyCHNO, was designed to ease, improve, and standardize current ichnological data collection techniques. With PyCHNO, ichnological data derived from burrow diameter measurements, trace fossil identification (ichnogenus level), and bioturbation index are collected at a user-defined scale, and size-diversity index is calculated from these measurements. Data collected in PyCHNO, including size-diversity index, maximum burrow diameter, trace fossil diversity, trace fossil taxon abundance, and bioturbation index is easily exported as text files or plotted as PDF logs.

Ángel Gallardo 470, Buenos Aires, Argentina","Complex ant nests from the lower Paleogene Maíz Gordo Formation of Salta (northwestern Argentina), included in the new ichnospecies Krausichnus sisi (Krausichnidae), are composed of columns of up to 1 m high and 160 flat, stacked chambers which are connected by vertical, straight, and parallel shafts. Columns are interconnected by lateral extensions of chambers, which are recognizable by their dark linings. Columns of densely packed flat chambers are similar to extant nests of Monomorium (Myrmicinae), which are postulated as the potential producers. Independent entrances and strong enlargements of columns by addition of chambers suggest that these functioned as individual, yet interconnected, nests. Such systems are compatible with polydomy, which is defined as the arrangement of an ant colony in at least two spatially separated nests. Krausichnus sisi traces polydomy in ants to the early Paleogene of South America in warm and semiarid fluvial valleys with calcareous sandy soils and dry woodland vegetation. These nests provide the oldest record of this behavior in ants and are a rare case for study of the underground architecture of polydomous nests.

A thin, elliptical lens of silty mudstone in the lower Kope Formation (Pioneer Valley submember, Southgate Member, C-1 Sequence) has several unique features mainly present on its basal surface, as a hyporelief, but also to a limited extent on the upper surface. Toward one end, the basal surface has sinuous fluting that terminates at the other end in a complex of conjoined, flattened, ellipsoidal or spatulate lobes that is partly overlain by an outlier of the primary lens. The basal surface has small-scale corrugations (3 to 4 mm wide) and polygonal reticulation variably developed. Articulated exoskeletons of small, spinose primaspid trilobites [Primaspis crosotus (Locke)] occur mostly with their ventral surfaces applied directly to the textured surfaces (i.e., dorsal side down). On some lobes the reticulate texturing wraps around from the basal to the upper surface and is covered with minute rounded pustules (∼ 0.3 mm). These enigmatic features are interpreted either as a recumbent microbial mat or an erect three-dimensional organism that was smothered and infilled by influx of silty sediment, preserved ultimately as a mold in hyporelief with trilobites in life position. Evidence for similar organic structures has not been previously reported from the Kope Formation. The taphonomic processes responsible for their preservation carry paleoenvironmental implications for possible microbial or macroalgal biotas within photic depths, and complex mediation of episodic depositional processes by organic biofilms or tissues.

The tridactyl track is bi-lobed in the 'heel' and the morphology allows attribution to a hadrosaurid. While adult hadrosaurs typically reached body lengths of 1200 cm, the length of this Alaskan pes impression is approximately 11 cm, which provides a hip height estimate of approximately 44-45 cm for this trackmaker. The manus impression is approximately 3.6 cm wide and 2.75 cm long. While hypothesized through studies of skeletal anatomy, given the small body size of the hadrosaur that made these tracks, this paired set of impressions indicates that at least some juvenile hadrosaurs were facultative quadrupeds rather than obligatory bipeds.

Hamelin Pool, which evolved into a restricted environment during the last few millennia, sustains the world's most extensive and diverse assemblage of modern marine stromatolites. These stromatolites occur in a shallow nearshore facies belt covering over 100 km of coast. Temperature, salinity, water level, and current data collected between 2012 and 2014 have revealed previously undocumented regional and seasonal trends. Regional trends include increasing salinity, greater temperature range, and decreasing energy moving southward from Faure Sill and to the Nilemah Embayment. Seasonal trends reveal paradoxically increased salinities in wet winter months and decreased salinity in dry summer months. When paired with annual tidal cycles, these trends suggest the influx of low salinity groundwater along the Hamelin Pool shelf. Speculation on how the documented environmental parameters may affect stromatolite growth suggests potential impact on morphology, internal fabric, and stromatolite-building microbial communities. These insights into environmental pressures within a living stromatolite system provide a framework for understanding extrinsic factors affecting microbial communities and stromatolite development throughout Earth history.

However, surveys limited by environment or taxon may not be applicable far beyond the bounds of the initial observations. Even when multiple studies exploring the potential variety within a taphonomic process exist, quantitative methods for comparing these datasets in order to identify larger scale patterns have been understudied. This research uses modern bite marks collected from 21 of the 23 generally recognized species of extant Crocodylia to explore statistical and phylogenetic methods of synthesizing taphonomic datasets. Bite marks were identified, and specimens were then coded for presence or absence of different mark morphotypes. Attempts to find statistical correlation between trace types, marking animal vital statistics, and sample collection protocol were unsuccessful. Mapping bite mark character states on a eusuchian phylogeny successfully predicted the presence of known diagnostic, bisected marks in extinct taxa. Predictions for clades that may have created multiple subscores, striated marks, and extensive crushing were also generated. Inclusion of fossil bite marks which have been positively associated with extinct species allow this method to be projected beyond the crown group. The results of this study indicate that phylogenies can and should be further explored for use as predictive tools in a taphonomic framework.

Here, we describe three gastric pellets with bird remains from the early Eocene Messel fossil site in Germany. A small, ball-shaped specimen that contains various broken bird bones resembles the pellets of owls and may have been produced by the Messel owl Palaeoglaux artophoron, which would make it the oldest owl pellet identified so far. The two other gastric pellets with bird remains have more elongated shapes and probably stem from snakes or other squamates. Both contain partially articulated bird skeletons, one of which belongs to an undescribed species that is otherwise unknown from the abundant avian fossil record from Messel. The fossil pellets described here therefore not only contribute to a better understanding of the avifauna of Messel, but are also important for reconstructing trophic webs and add to an understanding of the early Eocene Messel ecosystem.

Specialization increased during the evolution of tentaculitoid symbiosis. In the Devonian, specialized symbiotic endobiont genera appeared which did not occur separately from their hosts.

They inhabit ephemeral freshwater habitats with warm conditions and pH levels from neutral to alkaline. Many studies have been performed on the systematics of this group, also known as 'conchostracans', although the paleoecology of these clam shrimp has not been widely analyzed. This paper examines some aspects of the relationship between spinicaudatans and their environments from the Upper Jurassic (Canadon Asfalto Formation) of Argentina. We used sedimentological analysis to infer paleoenvironmental factors. Spinicaudatan features were also measured, including carapace size, growth band width, and growth lines. The results of this study reveal that the observed spinicaudatan species (Congestheriella rauhuti, Wolfestheria smekali, and Wolfestheria sp.) would have lived in carbonate lacustrine systems characterized by benthic microbial communities dominated by cyanobacteria. However, environmental factors such as oxygenation, pyroclastic deposits, and associated fauna (fish, ostracods, bivalves, and charophytes) were different at each locality. The spinicaudatan carapaces also show varying morphological features such as small or large carapace size, narrow or wide growth bands and low or high density of growth lines. These differences are related to abiotic (volcanic-oxygen) and biotic (fish and microbial) factors regarded as important agents for the development of the spinicaudatan populations.

Analyses of the burrow architecture and associated sedimentary facies aim to identify the possible trace makers, their behavior, and the local depositional conditions in the Olenekian (Early Triassic) in this part of Gondwana. The burrows were excavated into a floodplain where alternating periods of flooding, drying, and pedogenesis occurred, a set of conditions often mentioned for the Lower and Middle Triassic continental deposits in southern Gondwana. However, the burrow architecture and superficial morphology are distinct from previously reported older and younger burrows in this part of Pangea. These burrows are simple vertical shafts that are occasionally J-shaped with a circular to slightly elliptical cross-section (average aspect ratio 1.2), ~ 4 cm in diameter, 9-76 cm in length (average ~ 26 cm) and have subvertical axes with average vertical inclinations of approximately 30°. The passively filled burrow casts lack surficial morphology, lining, or branching and have semi-rounded and unenlarged burrow terminations. Potential burrow-makers, ranging from crayfish to lungfish and tetrapods, have been considered, but a definitive producer for these probably dwelling, preying and/or sheltering structures remains elusive. Finally, the results reinforce that burrowing into semi-arid floodplains was a favored behavior among certain organisms in southern Gondwana in the aftermath of the largest biological crisis in the Earth's history. The study also highlights stratigraphic changes in the style of burrow architecture. © Copyright 2016, SEPM (Society for Sedimentary Geology).",,burrowing; continental crust; crayfish; floodplain; fossil assemblage; Gondwana; ichnology; morphology; tetrapod; trace fossil; transition zone; Triassic; Eastern Cape; Karoo; South Africa; Astacoidea; Tetrapoda,,,,,"NKF, National Kidney Foundation of South Africa","We thank Levente Laczi-Papp for his field assistance and Robert Nagy for help with some of the close-up photographs.

Geologicas, FCEN, Universidad de Buenos Aires, IDEAN-CONICET, Argentina","Ancient desert deposits preserve a copious ichnofossil record, particularly Permian-age deposits where the record of tetrapod footprints is present and abundant in almost all desert settings. We propose to analyze, from a taphonomic perspective, Permian footprints preserved in eolian deposits from Argentina with a detailed sedimentological study of the trackway-bearing levels, in order to find evidence of processes that may have enhanced their preservation. We defined four taphonomic modes based on preservation quality, and the morphological and extra-morphological features of the footprints.Mode 1 includes footprints with detailed impressions of the palm, digits and claws. Mode 2 includes tracks with palm and digit impressions associated with small bulbous-shape marginal rims. Mode 3 includes tracks characterized by large, bulbous, marginal rims and randomly preserved palm impressions. Mode 4 includes footprints with shallow digit and palm impressions associated with sand-crescent marginal rims. The Los Reyunos footprints suggest preservation in: (1) dry sand, evidenced by sediment slipping down-slope structures and (2) subsurface damp sand, evidenced by digit impressions and claw drag traces. Also, we found vertical water content variations along the dune foresets, evidenced by a varying amount of sediment slipping down-slope in the same trackway. Moreover, differences in the time of entombment are suggested by the morphology of rims (bulbous-shape or sand-crescent). The stratigraphic genetic framework resulting from the Los Reyunos taphonomic analysis supports changes in the interstitial subsurface water and rapid entombment of the tracking surface due to a high rate of sediment supply as the main factor for footprint preservation. © Copyright 2016, SEPM (Society for Sedimentary Geology).",,biostratigraphy; eolian deposit; facies; footprint; fossil record; ichnology; morphology; Permian; preservation; taphonomy; tetrapod; trackway; Argentina; Tetrapoda,,,,,,,"Alexander, R.M., Estimates of the speeds of dinosaurs (1976) Nature, 261, pp. 129-130; Allen, J.R.L., Subfossil mammalian tracks (Flandrian) in the Severn Estuary (1997) Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B, Biological Sciences, 352, pp. 481-518. , S.

To date, collections made under permits issued by the Baxter State Park Commission originate from outcrop along Trout Brook, its tributaries, and poorly exposed lithologies inside the woodlands. Construction of a new roadway in the Scientific Forest Management Area, oriented parallel to Trout Brook, unearthed pavement exposures in which new fossil assemblages were found. These were collected under a salvage and conservation effort. Plant megafossils, as well as new macroinvertebrates and ichnofossils, were recovered from sandy siltstone and siltstone lithofacies along a west-to-east transect along Wadleigh Mountain Road. Autochthonous plants fossils include erect axes of cf. Psilophyton forbesii and vertical rooting structures of unknown affinity. Parautochthonous and allochthonous plants include Pertica quadrifaria, Taeniocrada dubia, three species of Psilophyton, and cf. Kaulangiophyton sp., all of which are known from the area. A newly discovered shell ground of a monotypic assemblage of Modiomorpha concentrica is accompanied by trace fossils assigned to Skolithos, Planolites, and Spirophyton. The invertebrates are described to have inhabited shallow, nearshore estuarine to open marine conditions, which are unreported in the area. The co-occurrence of Modiomorpha, Spirophyton, and allochthonous axes of Pertica and Psilophyton is used as additional evidence to support a brackish water, estuarine depositional environment for the Trout Valley Formation.

A biogenic origin for these structures would significantly augment the Proterozoic continental fossil record, which is currently poor, and also add to a growing body of sedimentological and geochemical data that, albeit indirectly, indicates the presence of life in continental settings early in Earth's history. These three-dimensional structures occur abundantly within a single cm-scale siltstone bed. Along this bedding plane, these structures are generally circular-to-ovoid, range up to several centimeters in diameter, and most specimens possess a transecting lenticular element. Structures exhibit sharp, well-rounded external margins and, in contrast to the surrounding aluminosilicate-rich matrix, are calcitic in composition. Surrounding sedimentary laminae are deflected by and cross cut the structures. A fossiliferous origin is considered but rejected and an authigenic concretionary origin is favored based on these characters. However, a concretionary origin does not exclude the possibility of a biogenic precursor that served as a locus for early diagenetic calcite precipitation. This study highlights the need for careful analysis of morphological, mineralogical, distributional, and sedimentological characteristics when considering the origin of enigmatic structures; morphological complexity alone is an insufficient criterion for assignment of biogenicity. The unusual morphology of these concretions augments known concretion morphologies generally comparable to unusual fossil forms, and draws into question the biogenicity of similarly cryptic Proterozoic structures including, in particular, those of the 2.0 Ga Francevillian B Formation of Gabon.

Given evidence for minimal transport the microvertebrates, macrovertebrates, coprolites, and plants may be reliably utilized for paleoecological analysis. Paleoenvironments shift upsection from nearshore marine, through tidal channel, to swamp, and, finally, to well-vegetated dry land. The faunas change from a basal layer of oysters with shark teeth to a microvertebrate assemblage just above logs with Teredolites borings and pristine leaves. Above the microvertebrates are diverse macrovertebrates including numerous dinosaurs associated with leaves, logs, and scrambling vines. The macrovertebrate layer is a rich assemblage of herbivorous and carnivorous dinosaurs, crocodiles, turtles, and rare pterosaurs. Several skeletal elements exhibit signs of predation that include punctures and gouges that precisely match crocodile and theropod teeth also recovered at the site. Abundant plant material that includes charred vines and logs is likely evidence of wildfires having ranged across the area. The preponderance of young dinosaur remains may support a wildfire scenario. An exposed surface with 24 coprolites, two hadrosaur vertebrae, logs, and in situ stumps caps the section. The larger coprolites are likely dinosaurian. Most contain plant materials while one contains a bone fragments suggesting the presence of herbivorous and carnivorous dinosaurs on the same surface, an occurrence that echoes herbivore/carnivore interactions in the underlying bonebed.

Here we examine fossil malacofauna from Olduvai Gorge, inclusive of new discoveries and previous reports, and survey their potential as paleoecologic indicators. Recorded for the first time from Olduvai, an assemblage of fossil bivalve shells is attributed by character comparison to modern Chambardia wahlbergi, a freshwater unionid species widespread across Africa. The fossilized shells were localized in Bed III conglomerate channel deposits, with channel geometry exhibiting scour bases and superimposed fill structures with fining upward sequences. The ecology of recent C. wahlbergi combined with sedimentological data indicate the aquatic environment in this region during Olduvai Bed III times can be reconstructed as a periodically desiccated floodplain bordering a river channel or channels with permanent running water and marked seasonal fluctuations. This paleo-environmental setting presents drastic change compared with that of the lower Bed I and Bed II deposits, when an alkaline/saline lake extended over the site and fresh water was restricted to standing groundwater-fed pools with snail species known today to be intermediate hosts for the trematode genera Schistosoma (schistosomiasis) and Fasciola (fascioliasis). This research enhances details of landscape evolution at Olduvai basin and furthers paleoenvironmental interpretations during the time of Bed III deposition. © 2016, SEPM.",,aquatic environment; bedrock; bivalve; fossil record; landscape evolution; macroinvertebrate; Olduvai event; paleoecology; paleoenvironment; reconstruction; river channel; seasonality; Arusha [Tanzania]; Olduvai Gorge; Tanzania; Bivalvia; Fasciola; Gastropoda; Schistosoma; Unionidae; Vertebrata,,,,,,,"Appleton, C., Kristensen, T.K., Stensgaard, A.-S., (2010) Chambardia Wahlbergi: The IUCN Red List of Threathened Species, Version 201.3, , www.iucnredlist.org, checked December 2015; Ashley, G.M., Geologists probe hominid environments (2000) GSA TODAY, 10, pp. 24-29; Ashley, G.M., Barboni, D., Doḿinguez-Rodrigo, M., Bunn, H.T., Mabulla, A., Diezmartin, F., Barba, R., Baquedano, E., Pal eoenvironmental and paleoecological reconstruction of a freshwater oasis in savannah grassland at flk north, olduvai gorge, Tanzania (2010) Quaternary Research, 74, pp. 333-343; Ashley, G.M., Hay, R.L., Sedimentation patterns in a plio-pleistocene volcaniclastic rift-margin basin, olduvai gorge, Tanzania (2002) Sedimentation in Continental Rifts, pp. 107-122. , in Ashley, G.M. and Renaut, R.W.

Laboratory investigation of these animals' activities demonstrates that the scallops on average resuspend 45 cm3 d-1 ind-1 via water jets ejected during swimming and clapping movement and that the ophiuroids on average disrupt 861 cm3 d-1 ind-1 via rowing motion and self-burial in the upper centimeters of the substrate. At observed densities in Explorers Cove, bioturbation rates greatly exceed sediment accumulation rates and physical reworking processes, resulting in homogenized sediment lacking both lamination and discrete traces that would signal its biogenic modification. Adamussium colbecki employs water jets to resuspend the limited phytodetritus needed by the suspension-feeding scallop in the quiet sub-sea ice conditions and produces depressions ~ 3 cm deep that increase substrate surface area and microtopography in Explorers Cove. The scallop thus acts as an ecosystem engineer, modifying the sediment and controlling the flux of materials between the substrate and water as it claps for food gathering rather than for predator evasion like other scallops. The resulting rapid, shallow diffuse bioturbation differs from the more commonly reported vertical bioturbation by infaunal animals recorded in cores, yet it exerts strong control on the sedimentary record and may be characteristic of low-energy, oligotrophic environments beneath multi-year sea ice around Antarctica where a lack of fast predators and low sedimentation rate allow proliferation of epifaunal animals. © 2016, SEPM.",,accumulation rate; benthic environment; biostratigraphy; bioturbation; bivalve; echinoderm; ecological approach; epifauna; movement; oligotrophic environment; sea ice; sedimentology; swimming behavior; Antarctica; East Antarctica; McMurdo Sound; Adamussium colbecki; Animalia; Ophionotus victoriae; Ophiuroidea; Pectinidae,,,,,,,"Alejandrino, A., Puslednik, L., Serb, J.M., Convergent and parallel evolution in life habit of the scallops (bivalvia: Pectinidae) (2011) BMC Evolutionary Biology, 11, pp. 164-173; Aller, R.C., The effects of macrobenthos on chemical properties of marine sediment and overlying water (1982) Animal-Sediment Relations, pp. 53-102. , in McCall, P.L. and Tevesz, M.J.S.

We studied 24 cold-methane seep deposits in the Upper Cretaceous (Campanian) Pierre Shale of southwestern South Dakota. These deposits were subdivided into three categories depending on their physical characteristics: (1) those with a single main conduit, few secondary pipes and concretionary bodies, and no carbonate cap, implying strong advective flow to the sedimentwater interface; (2) those with a single main conduit, a moderate number of secondary pipes and concretionary bodies, and a small carbonate cap, implying both advective and diffusive flow to the sediment-water interface; and (3) those with a single main conduit, a high number of secondary pipes and concretionary bodies, and a broad carbonate cap, implying extensive flow, but dampening at the sediment-water interface due to the presence of the large carbonate cap. We analyzed the faunal composition at all 24 seeps. The number of species ranges from five to 20. All of the seeps are dominated by baculitid ammonites, inoceramids, and lucinids (''foundation'' organisms). These species are the same as those in time-equivalent non-seep sites in the Pierre Shale and are not seep-obligate. However, in seep categories 2 and 3, the number and kind of secondary organisms increases in association with the development of the large carbonate cap. These organisms include oysters, gastropods, echinoids, sponges, crinoids, and scaphitid ammonites. We infer that these organisms appear because (1) the carbonate hardground provides a more diverse habitat allowing attachment and encrustation and (2) the bottom waters are better oxygenated and/or the level of hydrogen sulfide is reduced because the methane rich fluids are diverted away from the carbonate cap, thus providing a more suitable habitat for organisms such as scaphitid ammonites that require a well-oxygenated environment. However, even at these seeps, the number of secondary organisms usually does not exceed that of foundation organisms. © 2016, SEPM.",,bivalve; carbonate; cephalopod; cold seep organism; community structure; Cretaceous; echinoderm; encrustation; fossil record; hydrogen sulfide; methane; oxygenation; seafloor; sediment-water interface; sponge; zoogeographical region; South Dakota; United States; Baculitidae; Echinoida; Gastropoda; Inoceramidae; Lucinidae; Ostreidae; Pelmatozoa; Scaphitidae,,,,,,,"Agirrezabala, L.M., Kiel, S., Blumenberg, M., Schäfer, N., Reitner, J., Outcrop analogues of pockmarks and asso ciated methane-seep carbonates: A case study from the lower cretaceous (albian) of the basque-cantabrian basin, western pyrenees (2013) Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, 390, pp. 94-115; Amano, K., Jen Kins, R.G., Aikawa, M., Nobuhara, T., A miocene chemosynthetic community from the ogaya formation in joetsu: Evidence for depthrelated ecologic control among fossil seep communities in the Japan sea back-Arc basin (2010) Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, 286, pp. 164-170; Beauchamp, B., Savard, M., Cretaceous chemosynthetic carbonate mounds in the canadian arctic (1992) PALAIOS, 7, pp. 434-450; Beck, M.W., Separating the elements of habitat structure: Independent effects of habitat complexity and structural components on rocky intertidal gastropods (2000) Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology, 249, pp. 29-49; Bergquist, D.C., Ward, T., Cordes, E.E., McNelis, T., Howlett, S., Kosoff, R., Hourdez, S., Fisher, C.R., Community structure of vestimentifera n generated habitat islands from the upper Louisiana slope cold seeps (2003) Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology, 289, pp. 197-222; Bergquist, H.R., Cobban, W.A., Mollusks of the c retaceous (1957) Treatise on Marine Ecology and Paleoecology 2, Paleoecology: Geological Society of America Memoir, 67, pp. 871-884. , in Ladd, H.S.

The complex interactions among biological, taphonomic, and physical environmental processes influence the type and quality of information that can be drawn from these paleobiological repositories. This study examines the relative roles of bioclast input and burial on the formation of Middle-Upper Devonian skeletal concentrations from tropical carbonate-dominated settings. Based on original field observations of skeletal concentrations and host lithologies, skeletal concentrations are compared (1) between a thermally subsiding passive margin (Nevada) and a relatively stable cratonic interior (Iowa) and (2) across a range of comparable subtidal depositional environments. The majority of skeletal concentrations are thin (30 cm), monotypic, have simple internal stratigraphy, and exhibit moderate to high degrees of skeletal fragmentation and disarticulation. Compared to the subsiding margin of Nevada, the cratonic interior of Iowa preserves a higher proportion of polytaxic skeletal concentrations with complex internal stratigraphy and higher taphonomic damage, consistent with control by delayed or slow burial. From shallow to deep subtidal environments, stratigraphic thickness and internal complexity decrease and fragmentation increases, consistent with strong control of these attributes by the frequency of physical and biogenic reworking. While low bioclast production rates may exert a dominant control on the failure to accumulate thick, dense skeletal concentrations in these deposits, taphonomic and physical environmental processes, such as low net sediment accumulation, sediment winnowing and starvation, and bioturbation can explain much of the variation in Middle-Upper Devonian skeletal concentrations. © 2016, SEPM.",,biogenic material; biostratigraphy; bioturbation; carbonate; concentration (composition); depositional environment; Devonian; invertebrate; paleobiology; passive margin; skeleton; spatiotemporal analysis; taphonomy; Iowa; Nevada; United States; Invertebrata,,,,,,,"Abbott, S.T., Mid-cycle condensed shellbeds from mid-pleistocene cyclothems New Zealand: Implications for sequence architecture (1997) Sedimentology, 44, pp. 805-824; Abbott, S.T., Carter, R.M., Macrofossil associations from mid-pleistocene cyclot hems, castlecliff section, New Zealand: Implications for sequence stratigraphy (1997) PALAIOS, 12, p. 188; Alexander, R., Paleozoic brachiopod autecology based on taphonomy: Example from the devonian ross f ormation of Tennessee (USA) (1993) Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, 100, pp. 25-35; Bambach, R.K., Seafood through time: Changes in biomass energetics, and productivity in the marine ecosystem (1993) Paleobiology, 19, pp. 372-397; Banerjee, I., Kidwell, S.M., Significance of molluscan shell beds in sequence stratigraphy: An example from the lower cretaceous mannville group of cana da 1 (1991) Sedimentology, 38, pp. 913-934; Best, M.M.R., Ku, T.C.W., Kidwell, S.M., Walter, L.M., Carbonate preservation in shallow marine envir onments: Unexpected role of tropical siliciclastics (2007) Journal of Geology, 115, pp. 437-456; Brady, M., (2012) Carbonate Sequences from Cratonic Interior Versus Continental Margin Sett Ings: A Comparative Stratigraphic and Taphonomic Analysis of the Devonian of Iowa and Nevada, p. 622. , Ph.D. Dissertation, The University of Chicago Chicago; Brady, M.E., Stratigraphic completeness o f carbonate-dominated records from continental interiors versus continental margins: Stratigraphic thinning occurs via condensation and omission at multiple scales (2015) Journal of Sedimentary Research, 85, pp. 337-360; Brandt, D., Taphonomic grades as a classification for fossiliferous assemblages and implications for paleoecology (1989) PALAIOS, pp. 303-309; Brett, C., Sequence stratigraphy biostratigraphy, and taphonomy in shallow marine environments (1995) PALAIOS, 6, pp. 597-616; Brett, C., Baird, G., Comparative taphonomy: A key to paleoenvironmental interpretation based on fossil preservation (1986) PALAIOS, 1, pp. 207-227; Caron, V., Transgressive surfaces of erosion as sequence boundary markers in coolwater shel f carbonates (2004) Sedimentary Geology, 164, pp. 179-189; Cozar, P., Foraminiferal taphofacies in the mississippian rocks of the guadiato area sw Spain (2003) Facies, 49, pp. 1-18; Cummings, D.I., Arnott, R.W.C., Hart, B.S., Tidal signatures in a shelf-margin delta (2006) Geology, 34, p. 249; Dattilo, B., Brett, C., Tsujita, C., Sediment supply versus storm winnowing in the development of muddy and shelly interbeds from the upper ordovician of the cincinnati region, USA (2008) Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences, 45, pp. 243-265; Davies, D.J., Powell, E.N., Stanton, R.J., Relative rates of shell dissolution and net sediment accumulation-A commentary: Can shell beds form by the gradual accumulation of biogenic debris on the sea floor?

Within this regionally extensive ichnoassemblage, mean burrow diameters decrease abruptly by 26-29% (n = 1767) at the base of the Main Fossiliferous Layer (MFL) or laterally equivalent horizons. The base of the MFL has been previously interpreted as the K-Pg boundary based on the last occurrence of Cretaceous marine reptiles, birds, and ammonites, as well as iridium anomalies and associated shocked quartz. Along with the mean, the maximum and minimum burrow diameters exhibit a negative shift, which indicates that the changes are the result of a directional reduction in diameter, rather than an artifact of decreased variance. As a proxy for the size of the tracemaker, a change in burrow diameter indicates a decrease in thalassinid crustacean body size. We interpret this shift as dwarfing within the endobenthic community as detrital food sources became scarce following the mass extinction. Despite the difference in size, there is no change in framework geometry. Ichnofabric indices generally increase up-section at each site across the K-Pg chronostratigraphic boundary, indicating a regional reduction in sedimentation rate, which is supported by a gradual increase in glauconite maturity. Overall, the ichnological evidence at these localities suggests that a prolonged period of negative feedback followed a short-term positive endobenthic response across the K-Pg boundary.

Later studies identified fossils from the formation's older carbonates that were known to be Early Ordovician. A significant conodont fauna from a section on Gardison Ridge permits an even more precise definition of the formation which includes correlation with the classic North American Ibexian sequence of western Utah. While an important part of the earliest Ibexian sequence is missing on Gardison Ridge, the Opohonga Limestone there contains conodont elements representing seven zones and subzones of the type Ibexian and can be firmly correlated with conodont zones of the upper House and most of the Fillmore Formations of the Pogonip Group in the Ibex area. This correlation also confirms that the Sauk III-IV sequence boundary occurs in the lower part of the formation. The oldest conodont faunas of the Ibexian Series were not recovered from the lowest beds of the Opohonga Limestone, and it is possible that missing earliest Ibexian species in the oldest Opohonga beds may indicate that the poorly known underlying Ajax Dolomite, considered to be upper Cambrian, may actually include part of the basal Ordovician Ibexian Series.

However, seagrass itself has low preservation potential, and consequently seagrass meadows are hard to identify in the rock record. In this study we combine observational taphonomic data from a modern sparse seagrass meadow with actualistic taphonomic experiments, in order to test whether taphonomic disparity (i.e., evenness in the distribution of taphonomic grades among multiple individuals) in the larger benthic foraminiferan Archaias angulatus has potential as a paleo-indicator for seagrass dominated communities. Our observational study demonstrates that sparse seagrass meadows possess a higher proportion of both pristine and highly altered tests than non-seagrass settings. Our taphonomic experiments, conducted over a six-month period, demonstrate a greater magnitude of bioerosion and diversity of bioerosion types in foraminifera deployed within sparse seagrass patches, than those deployed in patches without any seagrass cover. Although our experimental results in particular have high variability, these combined approaches provide a link between pattern (high taphonomic disparity) and process (higher rates of bioerosion) in developing the taphonomic signature of seagrass meadows. On the basis of these results we suggest several taphonomic criteria that could be used to identify seagrass meadows in the rock record. These criteria are potentially species-independent, and so may have greater utility as seagrass proxies than invertebrate indicator species that frequently have limited temporal or spatial distributions.

Framboidal pyrite veneers are documented on fossilbearing horizons at multiple localities. The pyrite is interpreted to have formed via microbial processes in the hours to weeks following burial of benthic communities. This finding extends the 'death mask' model for Ediacaran soft-tissue preservation to deep-marine settings. Remineralization of pyrite to iron oxides and oxyhydroxides is recognized to result from recent oxidation by meteoric fluids in the shallow subsurface. Consideration of other global Ediacaran macrofossil occurrences reveals that pyrite is observed in association with Ediacaran macrofossils preserved in all four previously described styles of moldic preservation (Flinders-, Conception-, Fermeuse- and Nama-type). This suggests that replication of external morphology by framboidal pyrite was a widespread mechanism by which softbodied organisms and associated organic surfaces were preserved, in multiple facies and depositional environments, 580-541 million years ago. The extensive global burial of pyrite in medium- to coarse-grained clastics and carbonates is a previously unrecognized yet potentially significant geological sink of iron and sulfur, and may have contributed to rising atmospheric and marine oxygen concentrations across the late Ediacaran interval.

This apparent mass mortality is associated with the Christian Malford Lagerstätte in which there is exceptional, soft-bodied preservation of coleoid fossils. Statoliths are the aragonitic 'stones' that are found in the fluidfilled cavities (or statocysts) within the cartilaginous head of all modern and probably many fossil coleoids. Jurassic statoliths are largely undescribed and there are no known genera or species available to aid their classification. Otoliths, which may be of somewhat similar appearance, are the aragonitic stato-acoustic organs of bony (teleost) fish. These are more familiar to micropaleontologists and have a better known, though limited, fossil record. The abundance of statoliths in the Phaeinum Subzone at Christian Malford may indicate a mass mortality of squid that extends over some 3 m of strata and, therefore, a considerable interval of time. This has been tentatively interpreted as a record of a breeding area (and subsequent death) of squid-like cephalopods over an extended period of time rather than a small number of catastrophic events.

We examine the earliest known Jurassic carbonate ramp produced in the back-arc basin along NE Panthalassa following the extinction event to determine the biotic constituents and timing of local ecological recovery. Field observations, fossil surveys, and microfacies analysis focused on the Ferguson Hill Member (Hettangian and Sinemurian) of the Sunrise Formation in the New York Canyon area of west central Nevada, USA. In the Hettangian, post-extinction biosiliceous sedimentation extended to the inner ramp, where an ooid and grapestone shoal marked the outermost extent of a narrow belt of carbonate sedimentation. An early recovery phase in the late Hettangian is characterized by widespread, laterally homogeneous, demosponge-dominated level-bottom sedimentation across the mid-to inner-ramp, in addition to limited trophic tiering (sessile epifaunal suspension feeding and mobile infaunal deposit feeding), substantial ramp aggradation, and poor settling conditions for competitive benthic colonizers (e.g., corals, crinoids, infaunal bivalves). Within 1.6-2 Myr after the extinction (in the early Sinemurian), a late recovery phase is recognized by the appearance of epifaunal grazers (gastropods, echinoids) and suspension feeders (crinoids, solitary scleractinian corals), phototrophic microbialites (oncoids, and possibly photosymbionts within corals), and infaunal deposit or suspension feeders (bivalves). Although the late recovery faunas included more trophic levels than preextinction carbonate ramp habitats, development and progradation of the first Jurassic carbonate ramp still relied heavily on sponge, microbialite, and abiotic mineralization.

An alternative mode of preservation by entombment in calcite, without replacement, has been identified in carbonate cave pool microbialites that were etched and examined in the scanning electron microscope (SEM). Features identified include filaments, threads, and films that show excess carbon in energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analyses, suggesting preservation of organic matter. Filaments are single smooth or reticulated strands with curving string-like morphology, often hollow, and with a uniform diameter of 0.5 to 1.0 lm. Threads, in contrast, are variable thickness, from several microns down to 0.1 lm, always solid, and commonly branch. Films are thin (, 1 lm) drapes associated with threads. Filaments are interpreted as microbial filaments, while threads and films are interpreted as preserved extracellular polymeric substance (EPS). In addition, microbial filaments and EPS are only revealed via acid etching, suggesting preservation of organic material by entombment, not by replacement with calcite. To determine whether entombed microbes are a common feature of carbonate microbialites that form in different environmental settings, samples of hot spring travertine, caliche soil, and reef microbialite were examined. Whereas the travertine samples were barren, entombed EPS was found in the caliche soil and the reef microbialite; the latter also contained a few entombed filaments. In addition, entombed microbial material has been reported from carbonate cold seep deposits. Such findings indicate that entombment of microbes and EPS in carbonates is not restricted to cave settings, but is more widespread than previously reported. Possible causes for the lack of preservation in travertines include rapid degradation of microbial material either by sunlight due to photolytic degradation, aerobic microbial degradation, detritivore consumption, or elevated temperatures. Rapid carbonate precipitation is ruled out as, somewhat surprisingly, preservation is better in slower growing cave carbonates than in rapidly growing travertines. Potential long-term preservation of organic material entombed in carbonate has implications for the characterization of fossil microbial communities using molecular biomarkers and the search for life on other planets.

It represents the northern extension of the large Apulia Carbonate Platform and preserves an excellent record of the progressive decay of trophic conditions due to the approach of foredeep systems characterized by turbiditic siliciclastic sedimentation during the early Messinian. Sedimentological and compositional analyses were used to reconstruct the depositional model and evolution of platform environmental conditions. The profile is consistent with a homoclinal carbonate ramp, with a wide middleramp environment in which coralline algae, mainly forming the mäerl facies, dominated carbonate production. This facies was associated with seagrass meadows colonizing the inner ramp. The outer ramp was characterized by bioturbated hemipelagic marl with planktonic foraminifera and pectinids in the aphotic zone. Three main stages of ramp evolution have been identified. During the first stage, the ramp was subjected to high-energy wave-dominated conditions, which favored the development of deep rip channels in which accumulations of vertebrate bones have been identified. In the second stage, mäerl facies and seagrass meadows developed, initially in an oligotrophic setting, later followed by a slight reduction in light penetration. The third stage involved a general increase in fine terrigenous sediments, together with a further decrease in light and also by the spread of coralline algal bindstone facies. This elevated terrigenous input was associated with increased trophic conditions, as also shown by the occurrence of abundant plankton and low-oxygenated foraminiferal assemblages.

There is therefore a need to document Lower Triassic ichnofaunas to understand their significance with respect to the end-Permian crisis. In light of this need, this paper describes a novel Lower Triassic ichnosite at Mount Pallone (Carnic Alps, Italy), where the Campil Member (Smithian) of the Werfen Formation (Griesbachian-Spathian) presents an abundant ichnofauna characterized by excellent preservation and low diversity. Documented ichnogenera include Asteriacites lumbricalis, Gyrochorte comosa, Diplocraterion habichi and Planolites beverleyensis. The ichnofaunal composition and the bioturbation style suggest a marginal marine paleoenvironment ranging from intertidal to shallow subtidal settings. Storm influence, hydrodynamic energy, sedimentation rate, freshwater input and/or water temperature played an important role in structuring the benthic ecosystem. Dense (300 specimens/m2) aggregations of the trace fossil Asteriacites lumbricalis reveals social behavior of their inferred brittlestar producers (Echinodermata, Ophiuroidea). In line with modern brittlestar beds, social behavior provided significant advantage because raised arms of brittlestars dampened hydrodynamic energy. This study suggests that Asteriacites beds may be considered ichnological proxies for marine settings, low bioturbation intensity, shallow tiering, high sedimentation rate and/or event-bed deposition, significant levels of hydrodynamic energy, and low predation pressure. The studied ichnofauna reflects stressed environmental conditions, but it is unclear whether this reflects local brackish conditions ('Gazpacho model') or global hot temperatures ('Hot Soup model').

Fossiliferous bulk samples of shallow marine carbonates were collected from the Luning and Gabbs formations in west-central Nevada to evaluate the changes in faunal composition and paleoecological structure during the Norian Stage. Stationary epifauna dominated the early Norian faunal assemblages but gradually became less common by the late Norian, with the exception of cementing bivalves, which were common in the middle and late Norian. After the early Norian, mobile infauna also became increasingly abundant and diverse. These paleoecological trends are similar to those observed in Tethyan level-bottom carbonate deposits from the Lombardian Basin in northern Italy. Reclining epifauna remained uncommon in the local area until the Early Jurassic, and this Mesozoic decline in recliners preceded the end-Triassic mass extinction in Nevada.

Mollusks are common, along with bryozoan zooecia, echinoderm ossicles, and other taxa. Similar occurrences of Ordovician micromorphic mollusks have been interpreted as ecologically dwarfed and adapted to oxygen-starved conditions, an interpretation with implications for ocean anoxia. An alternative explanation for small phosphatic steinkerns is taphonomic. Stable carbonate fluorapatite selectively filled small voids, thus preserving small fossils, including larval/young mollusks. Reworking concentrated small phosphatic steinkerns from multiple generations while larger, unfilled calcareous shells were destroyed, resulting in small fossils progressively replacing larger fossils. With thin sections and insoluble residues, we document evidence that many of these steinkerns are incomplete (""teilsteinkerns"") recording small parts of larger, normal-sized animals, or juveniles, along with smaller species. This finding suggests that these fossil assemblages are taphonomically, not ecologically, size-limited. Based on the ecology of modern oxygen minimum zones in which shelled mollusks are rare, the presence of abundant shelled organisms actually argues against severe oxygen stress. Our results also imply that the process by which the ""small shelly fossils"" of the Cambrian were preserved continued into the Ordovician.

Differences in their foliage suggest that some seed ferns may have had a higher preservation potential when compared to marattialean ferns. Should this be accurate, it would suggest that when the two groups are found together, marattialean ferns would be better preserved and potentially better represented than seed ferns. Such taphonomic biases would have direct implications for evaluating plant diversity in deep time. To evaluate this hypothesis, we analyzed more than 880 fern and seed fern fossils encased in siderite (FeCO3) concretions from the ∼ 308 Ma Mazon Creek Lagerstatte to test if seed fern foliage is better preserved than fern foliage with respect to taxonomic information. For comparative purposes, we conducted a series of decay experiments on two modern ferns and a cycad (the last providing a seed fern analogue) for 160 days. Despite anatomical and compositional differences, fossil analyses demonstrate that ferns and seed ferns are equally well preserved in the Mazon Creek Lagerstatte with respect to venation, which represents one of the most important taxonomic characters of the flora. The decay experiments support this conclusion: despite having a more robust leaf, cycad leaves decayed at a similar rate to the thinner, more hypothetically fragile ferns. Together, our results indicate that our ability to discriminate within and between ferns and seed ferns is not biased by differential preservation in the Mazon Creek flora.

Autocomposite ichnofabrics, which comprise a single ichnocoenosis, form by gradual upward migration of vertically partitioned benthic communities in pace with sedimentation; because they are presumed to reflect paleoenvironmental stasis, they are most useful in assessing aspects of benthic paleoecology (e.g., endobenthic tiering). Heterocomposite ichnofabrics comprise two or more ichnocoenoses produced in response to short- to long-term environmental perturbations within a depositional system; they reflect depositional process (e.g., event sedimentation) and longerterm paleoenvironmental dynamics. Ultracomposite ichnofabrics form by overprinting of ichnocoenoses that are significantly temporally disjunct and reflect bioturbation in disparate depositional systems. Although the latter ichnofabrics are comparatively rare, their recognition is vital for paleoichnologic studies, particularly those that target surface exposures upon which there may be a modern biogenic overprint.

The flora exhibits many well-preserved examples of insect folivory for which the extent and type of damage on each leaf was recorded. Fewer than half of the specimens in the collection exhibit insect damage and most of the leaf damage affects less than five percent of the leaf area. Damage was distributed unevenly across the 18 leaf morphotypes described in the flora. Nineteen damage types were recognized. Most of the damage was of a generalized type, dominated by indiscriminate removal of leaf tissues (whole leaf feeding). We observed no correlation between leaf mass per area (MA) and the degree of damage by herbivores, which contrasts with Cenozoic and modern patterns. The low rate, modest area, and low diversity of damage type is similar to patterns reported through the Late Cretaceous and is consistent with a plateau in insect folivore diversity that persisted through the end of the Mesozoic. The preponderance of generalized damage types dominated by whole leaf feeding may reflect (1) the early stage in angiosperm radiation represented by this flora, and (2) the associated lag in folivore diversification and specialization.

High resolution microfaunal and stable isotope (δ18O, δ13C; VPDB) data from a key outcrop of marl and claystone record an abrupt change in water chemistry that we interpret to be the result of a catastrophic sill breach. Basal marl contains a mix of brackish-water ostracodes and marine foraminifers. Ostracode δ18O values are slightly negative and 6% higher than the host sediment carbonate precipitated in the upper water column, indicating isotopically stratified hydrologic conditions during deposition. Freshwater ostracodes abruptly appear in the overlying sediments in association with marine foraminifers, in conjunction with an abrupt change in the isotopic composition of ostracode and host sediment carbonate. The δ18O values from brackish and freshwater ostracodes and the host sediment carbonate are similar (, -10%), indicating an isotopically well-mixed water body during deposition. Sediment δ13C values decrease by 4.5% across this transition but ostracode δ13C values remain unchanged. We infer that the transition from stratified to well-mixed conditions likely took less than 300 years. The abruptness of this transition is best explained by catastrophic failure of a paleodam that rapidly altered the isotopic composition and salinity of a lake in Blythe basin. A marine or estuarine environment is unlikely. Our interpretation is consistent with other evidence for catastrophic breaching of another lacustrine Bouse Formation-bearing basin to the north.

These structures likely originated as mucus films secreted by epibenthic or shallow endobenthic organisms, perhaps grazing gastropods and errant worms. Whatever their progenitors, mucus films served as labile hosts for sulfate-reducing bacteria and, consequently, were primary sites for very early iron-sulfide mineralization in Ingersoll substrates. Without mucus secretion and subsequent pyritization, evidence for relatively pervasive biogenic activity and environmental conditions would not have been preserved. By contrast, pyritization of body fossils in the Ingersoll shale terrestrial biota was limited, reflecting inhibited degradation of constituent refractory organic compounds in rapidly deposited, oxygen-deficient sediments. © Copyright 2016, SEPM Society for Sedimentary Geology.",,benthos; biofilm; Cretaceous; environmental conditions; mineralization; mucus; preservation; pyrite; secretion; shale; sulfate-reducing bacterium; Alabama; United States; Gastropoda,,,,,"EAR-0633839, NSF, National Science Foundation",Initial collection of the archived Ingersoll shale samples used in this study was supported by NSF grant EAR-0633839.,"Aller, R.C., The effects of macrobenthos on chemical properties of marine sediment and overlying water (1982) Animal-Sediment Relation - The Biogenic Alteration of Sediments, pp. 53-102. , in McCall, P.L. and Tevesz, J.S.

In this study, the sclerobiont faunas of Weavericeras vacaense (a spherocone) and Holcoptychites agrioensis (a discocone), two early Hauterivian ammonites from the Agrio Formation (Neuquén Basin, Argentina) were compared. The coeval nautilid Cymatoceras perstriatum (studied previously), was contrasted with both ammonites. Results show that the three sclerobiont faunas had similar abundance, taxonomic composition and distribution of individuals across the shells, but H. agrioensis showed a markedly reduced richness, with a fauna almost entirely composed by the oyster Amphidonte (Ceratostreon) sp. The more evolute and compressed H. agrioensis sank more quickly than W. vacaense and C. perstriatum, which may have undergone longer periods of flotation and exposure on the sea bottom. This agrees with the lower taxonomic richness of the sclerobiont fauna and a better overall preservation of H. agrioensis specimens. Differences in the sclerobiont faunas are greater across variations in shell inflation and coiling degree than across nautilids and ammonites; therefore, the latter are important parameters for the sclerobiont fauna as well since they impact how long shells will float and be exposed on the seafloor, and therefore on their time of exposure. The presence of an almost monospecific fauna in H. agrioensis, despite its rapid sinking and burial, indicates that Amphidonte (Ceratostreon) sp. was the earliest settler, and could abundantly colonize hard substrates in a short time. © Copyright 2016, SEPM Society for Sedimentary Geology.",,biostratigraphy; burial diagenesis; fauna; Hauterivian; mollusc; morphology; preservation; shell; species richness; substrate; Argentina; Cephalopoda; Nautilida; Ostreidae,,,,,,,"Aguirre-Urreta, M.B., (2013) Amonoideos Del Valanginiano-Hauteriviano de la Cuenca Neuquina: Sistemática, Bioestratigrafía y Paleobiogeografía, 269p. , http://digital.bl.fcen.uba.ar/Download/Tesis/Tesis_5374_AguirreUrreta.pdf, Unpublished PhD thesis, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires; Aguirre-Urreta, M.B., Rawson, P.F., The ammonite sequence in the Agrio Formation (Lower Cretaceous), Neuquén Basin, Argentina (1997) Geological Magazine, 134, pp. 449-458; Aguirre-Urreta, M.B., Rawson, P.F., Lower Cretaceous ammonites from the Neuquén Basin, Argentina: The Hauterivian genus Holcoptychites (2003) Cretaceous Research, 24, pp. 589-613; Aguirre-Urreta, M.B., Rawson, P.F., Lower Cretaceous ammonites from the Neuquén Basin, Argentina: The neocomitids of the Pseudofavrella angulatiformis Zone (upper Valanginian) (2010) Cretaceous Research, 31, pp. 321-343; Aguirre-Urreta, M.B., Rawson, P.F., Lower Cretaceous ammonites from the Neuquén Basin, Argentina: A new heteromorph fauna from the uppermost Agrio Formation (2012) Cretaceous Research, 35, pp. 208-216; Aguirre-Urreta, M.B., Rawson, P.F., Concheyro, G.A., Bown, P.R., Ottone E G, Y., Lower Cretaceous (Berriasian and Aptian) biostratigraphy of the Neuquén Basin (2005) The Neuquén Basin: A Case Study in Sequence Stratigraphy and Basin Dynamics: Geological Society, 252, pp. 57-81. , in Veiga, G., Spalletti, L.A., Howell, L.A. and Schwarz, E.

These rugosans display vertical to subvertical attachment scars and are more common in the Ludfordian than in the Pridoli. The unknown hosts provided a higher tier for the feeding, making the association beneficial for the rugosans. Several rugosans were themselves syn vivo encrusted by bryozoans and unknown endobiotic tubicolous organisms, possibly cornulitids. Estonian rugosans appear to have been host size selective and preferred substrates of certain size. Silurian symbiotic rugosans are more often endobionts in stromatoporoids than epibionts on the vertical stems. © Copyright 2016, SEPM Society for Sedimentary Geology.",,biostratigraphy; body size; bryozoan; coral; epibiont; feeding behavior; fossil record; paleobiology; Silurian; symbiosis; England; Estonia; Ludlow; Saaremaa; Shropshire; United Kingdom; Bryozoa; Stromatoporoida,,,,,Estonian Research Competency Council; ETF9064; IUT20-34,Financial support to O.V. was provided by a Palaeontological Association Research Grant and Estonian Research Council projects ETF9064 and IUT20-34.,"Ausich, W.I., Smith, D.P., New evidence for the early life history of solitary rugose corals (1982) Journal of Paleontology, 56, pp. 1223-1229; Ausich, W.I., Wilson, M.A., Vinn, O., Crinoids from the silurian of Western Estonia (2012) Acta Palaeontologica Polonica, 57, pp. 613-631; Ausich, W.I., Wilson, M.A., Vinn, O., Wenlock and Pridoli (Silurian) crinoids from Saaremaa, Western Estonia (Phylum Echinodermata) (2015) Journal of Paleontology, 89, pp. 72-81; Bassett, M.G., Popov, L.E., Holmer, L.E., The oldest-known metazoan parasite?

TOC content levels were similar to the labile pool of carbon suggesting the absence of recalcitrant carbon in these soils. LOC ranged between 2 to 60 mg/g of soil. PLFA analysis indicated a maximum of 2.3 × 105 cell equivalents/g. Culturing of soil extracts yielded 1.1 × 102-3.7 × 103 CFU/g. qRT-PCR showed between 1.0 × 102 and 8 × 103 cells/g; and DAPI fluorescent staining indicated bacteria counts up to 5 × 104 cells/g. Arid and semiarid samples (controls) showed values between 107 and 1011 cells/g with all of the methods used. Importantly, the concentration of microorganisms in hyper-arid soils did not show any correlation with the organic carbon content; however, there was a significant dependence on the oxidant activity present in these soil samples evaluated as the capacity to decompose sodium formate in 10 hours. We suggest that the analysis of oxidant activity could be a useful indicator of the microbial habitability in hyper-arid soils, obviating the need to measure water activity over time. This approach could be useful in astrobiological studies on other worlds.

Six teeth of large carnivorous theropods collected from four Cretaceous formations deposited under contrasted climates have been sampled. These teeth have been analyzed for the oxygen isotope compositions of their apatite phosphate (δ18Op) through incremental sampling performed along the major growth axis. Significant fluctuations in oxygen isotope compositions along the growth axis of each tooth are observed and interpreted as reflecting seasonality in ingested local surface water δ18Ow values. Fluctuations in δ18Op values of theropod teeth from the Aptian of Thailand and Cenomanian of Morocco vary similarly to meteoric water δ18Omw values occurring today in sub-tropical regions subjected to large seasonal amounts of precipitations. A dinosaur tooth recovered from the more inland and mid-latitude Nemegt Formation of Mongolia shows a seasonal pattern similar to present-day cold temperate and continental climate. Finally, the high latitude and coastal Kakanaut Formation (Russia) experienced strongly dampened seasonal variations, most likely due to the influence of warm Pacific oceanic currents. Such conditions occur today in high latitude regions submitted to marine influence. These results further highlight the potential of using the oxygen isotope compositions of large theropod teeth to reconstruct past seasonal variations of terrestrial climates. Increased knowledge of past seasonality may help to better understand the complex interactions between climate and the dynamics of land biodiversity in terms of ecological adaptations, biogeography and the evolutionary history of organisms.

Among those drilled, 38% (22 individuals) had multiple drill holes with up to four holes present. Most holes were complete, circular to sub-circular in outline, averaging 0.5 mm in diameter, and belong to the ichnospecies Sedilichnus simplex. The distribution of holes on the test was non-random: 1) the aboral surface was drilled preferentially, and 2) the central region of the aboral surface had a significantly higher number of holes (p <0.005) than expected. No evidence of size selectivity was detected: The relationship between drill hole size and test size of Fibularia was not significant (p <0.1). The distribution of drill holes as well as their shape and size make it likely that they were produced by a predatory gastropod, such as the cassid Galeodea that is known from the Oligocene of New Zealand. However, the high frequency of multiply drilled Fibularia allows for the possibility of a parasite, such as the eulimid Niso, another New Zealand gastropod coeval with Fibularia. This study adds to the growing body of literature on the drilling of echinoids, shedding light on the ecology of this group.

(2014) assertion that the Cotham Marble is an indicator of late Triassic mass extinction unconvincing. Their statement that a microbialite facies extends for over 2000km2 is misleading. A distinctive micritic bed is indeed widespread but the distribution of the microbialite facies is patchy and local. The fauna, flora, facies, and sedimentology above and below Cotham Marble are entirely consistent with it developing in a lagoonal setting in an overall transgression. Describing its depositional setting as a 'dead zone' is inappropriate and a distraction from understanding the complex depositional, tectonic, and environmental factors which caused a number of rapid changes in the facies, fauna, and flora during the late Triassic transgression succession in southwestern Britain. Microtubus communis is an important component in the construction of the digitate 'landscape' form of the Cotham Marble. Ibarra et al. (2014) have overlooked some key outcrops of the facies in North Somerset in which small mounds clearly show the intimate development of the start of vertical digitate morphologies associated with the presence of Microtubus communis.

Similar textures preserved in ancient microbialites are useful biosignatures when filaments are no longer preserved, but have typically been observed within stromatolites. This study describes bubble-Associated fenestrae within oncoids from the early Cambrian Bayan Gol Formation of Mongolia. Fenestrae appear in mm-scale micritic laminae which contain dense accumulations of large (10 3 300 mm) filamentous Girvanella microfossils. Many laminae are not spherical, often occurring with one flat side opposite a conical peak. Up to six generations of conical geometry are present, with each cone rotated with respect to the previous peak. We hypothesize that the oncoids experienced intermittent disturbances followed by periods of stasis and vertical growth. During resting periods, we hypothesize that flat areas formed the oncoid resting base and peaked areas the top. The presence of bubble laminae within peaks implies formation in part via entrapment of microbially produced gases. Examples of resting oncoids growing into stromatolites are well known, as well as irregularly laminated oncoids with no cones; the Bayan Gol Formation samples are intermediate between typical spherical oncoids and stromatolites. The preservation of cones also provides evidence for relatively rapid mineralization in the Cambrian ocean, as antecedent microbial tufts would likely have collapsed if disturbed before calcification.

Here we present a new record of P. palmata from Dry Tortugas National Park in the Florida Keys and infer its likely age. Although most existing records of P. palmata are from the sub-Aerial reef deposits of MIS5e (, 125 ka), the presently submerged reef in the Dry Tortugas was too deep (. 18 m) during this period to support significant reef growth. In contrast, the maximum water depth during MIS5a (, 82 ka) was only , 5.6 m, which would have been ideal for P. palmata. Diagenetic alteration prevented direct dating of the samples; however, the similarity between the depths of the Pleistocene bedrock in the Dry Tortugas and other reefs in the Florida Keys, which have been previously dated toMIS5a, support the conclusion that P. palmata likely grew in the Dry Tortugas during this period. Our study provides important new information on the history of P. palmata, but it also highlights the vital need for more comprehensive studies of the Quaternary history of Caribbean reef development. With modern reef degradation already driving yet another restructuring of Caribbean coral assemblages, insights from past extinctions may prove critical in determining the prognosis of Caribbean reefs in the future.

The premise behind these hypotheses is that predators select prey to ensure maximum gain per unit effort; for example, by selecting species that are more abundant or accessible. In this study, we tested for predator selectivity in a tropical molluscan assemblage by quantifying the influence of relative abundance (encounter frequency) on predation frequencies. We collected macromollusks (. 4 mm) from 15 sites in three soft-sediment reef lagoons at One Tree Reef (southern Great Barrier Reef, Australia). Dead mollusks were counted and identified to species level (61 species, n = 8131), and species predation frequencies were calculated as the proportion of shells with drill holes. We found that in this infauna-dominated community, levels of drilling predation were low (7.14% on average), and there was no evidence that predators selected prey based on encounter frequency. This result was consistent across prey species and lagoons. Thus, drilling predators did not specialize on more accessible prey species and were not a major cause of mortality in this modern macromollusk assemblage. Since drilling gastropods are size selective, lack of selectivity in our samples only applies to the prey size range considered. Detailed studies of prey morphological traits, as well as accounting for predator non-consumptive effects could shed light on the preferences and relevance of drilling gastropods in this soft-sediment carbonate reef assemblage.

Dissolved oxygen (DO) and pH profiles were monitored over 1,000 days with microelectrodes positioned inside and adjacent to carcasses. In the vicinity of fish, the DO varied from an oxygenated green upper layer to an anoxic bottom stratum and the pH was alkaline. Inside the fish, the DO and the pH were decoupled during the first week, in that anoxia remained constant and the pH decreased and became acidic. Once covered by the mat, the fish carcass turned oxic and pH returned to alkaline levels. This novel second phase occurred from day 90 to three years and would likely remain after this time. Based on the fish soft tissue quality at the end of the experiment, we discuss whether oxic-alkaline microenvironmental conditions could promote organic preservation and long-term mineralization.

This is only the second marine interval found in the entire Pennsylvanian fill of the Maritimes Basin of Canada, the other being recently found in the broadly same-age Joggins Formation of Nova Scotia. Evidence for the new marine transgression comprises an echinoderm-rich limestone that infills irregularities on a vertic paleosol surface within the distal facies of a syntectonic fluvial megafan formed under a seasonally dry tropical climate. Gray, platy ostracod-rich shales and wave-rippled sandstone beds that directly overlie the marine limestone contain trace fossils characteristic of the Mermia Ichnofacies, upright woody trees, and adpressed megafloras. This association represents bay-fills fringed by freshwater coastal forests dominated by pteridosperms, cordaites, and other enigmatic plants traditionally attributed to dryland/upland habitats. The fossil site demonstrates that marine transgressions extended farther into the interior of Pangea than has previously been documented, and may allow correlation of the Tynemouth Creek and Joggins Formations with broadly coeval European successions near the level of the Gastrioceras subcrenatum and G. listeri marine bands. It also helps explain the close similarity of faunas between the Maritimes Basin and other paleotropical basins, if transgressions facilitated migration of marine taxa into the continental interior.

Although the Cotham Marble is patchy and the unit is morphologically variable, laminated and dendrolitic phases can be traced for at least 100 km (Fig. 1), thus making the microbialite unit, in our opinion, remarkably laterally extensive, encompassing a conservative aerial extent of ∼ 2,000 km2. Ibarra et al. (2014) highlight the Cotham Marble's previously unreported lateral extent and the widespread co-occurrence of Tasmanites. These observations along with the stratigraphic level at which the Cotham Marble occurs, link the Cotham Marble to the end-Triassic extinction in the southwestern United Kingdom and to other end-Triassic sections across Europe. The Cotham Marble continues to be known primarily for its 'Landscape-like', dendrolitic features. The paucity of Microtubus in the typical dendrolitic 'Landscape' (shown in Fig. 3) and as explained in Ibarra et al. (2014), reveals that although Microtubus is indeed associated with the Cotham Marble, it is not integral to the construction of its iconic dendrolitic phases. The samples shown by Mayall and Wright appear to be an unusual exception and would likely fall under one of the alternate 'forms' (cf.

It consists of specimens from at least 63 individuals from an anomalously high concentration of fossils distributed laterally and vertically in a meter-thick fine-grained deposit. Two new taxa from the genera Sphenodontia and Eucynodontia had previously not been found in Argentine Triassic quarries. The bonebed is preserved in a mudflow deposit interbedded with calcic-Argillisols in the medial-distal zone of a distributary fluvial system (DFS). The accumulation is characterized by small-sized skeletal fragments (skulls, jaws and vertebra; all less than 50 mm), low degree of articulation, variable degrees of subaerial exposure, tooth marks, surface dissolution, and an alkaline authigenic mineral suite. Detailed paleoenvironmental and taphonomic characterization indicate that this accumulation underwent three stages in its taphonomic history: (1) biogenic extrinsic concentration; (2) local transportation and re-deposition by a mudflow on a swampy floodplain; and (3) drying and pedogenesis. Additionally, the deposit highlights biogenic activity as a way to concentrate a paleofaunal assemblage that likely represents the original community, and mudflow deposits from crevasse splays in DFS as a potential facies for microfossil preservation.

Paleoecological analysis of Pliensbachian shell accumulations from northeast Italy, Southern Alps, records successive phases of colonization and demise, each of which are characterized by specific taphonomic features and sedimentary fabrics. Field studies were augmented by serial sectioning and thin sections revealing microfacies and microtaphofacies, as well as scanning electro-microscopy (SEM) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). The term bivalve carpet is introduced to describe the original geometry of the bivalve accumulation colonizing the substrate. Within a lagoonal depositional setting, small, thin-shelled Isognomonidae-like bivalves lived as endo-byssate, non-siphonate suspension feeders. These bivalves, interpreted as juveniles, constructed bivalve carpets with a primary lateral extension while lacking a distinct vertical growth. Bivalves colonized firm, dysoxic carbonate substrates consisting of a mixture of peloids, bioclasts, and chemolithotrophic iron-oxidizing bacteria. Oxygen-rich bottom currents and microbial activity stabilized the lagoon floor thus allowing for the episodic settlement of fixosessile bivalves and their autochthonous preservation. Short-term anoxic phases interpreted to reflect seasonal decreases in water energy resulted in the mass mortalities of the juvenile bivalves. The abundance of articulated, vertical orientated valve pairs in the shell accumulations indicate that the bivalve carpets were embedded soon after the death of the organisms without prior physical disturbance.

The extinct nannofossil taxa Biscutum spp., Tranolithus orionatus and Zeugrhabdotus spp. are commonly thought to have preferred nutrient-rich surface waters. In order to test this hypothesis, calcareous nannofossils from two lower Turonian nearshore sections (Bochum, Herne; northwest Germany) were studied. These sections, which reflect a mesotrophic and perhaps cool paleoenvironment, contain well-preserved and highly diverse calcareous nannofossil assemblages yielding 92 species. Based on the first occurrences of Eprolithus eptapetalus, Quadrum gartneri, and Eiffellithus eximius, both sections have been assigned an early Turonian age. The most common taxa are Watznaueria barnesiae, Zeugrhabdotus spp., Biscutum constans, Prediscosphaera cretacea, and Tranolithus orionatus. In combination with previously published data from pelagic settings of the same area, these new findings allow the reconstruction of a nearshore-offshore transect. In proximal sections the abundances of B. constans and T. orionatus are higher than in coeval assemblages from distal localities. Zeugrhabdotus spp. shows no specific preference, whereas W. barnesiae is more common in open ocean settings. These findings suggest that B. constans and T. orionatus preferred more fertile and perhaps cooler nearshore habitats whereas W. barnesiae was adapted to oligotrophic and probably warmer paleoenvironments.

Unisinos, 950, Sao Leopoldo RS, Brazil","Fecal pellet-filled trace fossil Phymatoderma burkei from the Permian shallow-marine Teresina Formation (southern Brazil) was microscopically and geochemically investigated to reveal the significance of physicochemical processes in the preservation of invertebrate fecal pellets. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis shows micron-sized spherules only in the pelletal infill of P. burkei, but not within the surrounding host sandstone. These spherules show highly uniform morphology and size (approximately 1 mm), and generally have hollow structures occasionally occurring as aggregates. Geochemically, such spherules are characterized by presence of Fe and Mn, occasionally with Ba. The evidence suggests that the spherules are mineral-replaced or mineral-encrusted microbial cells, which are most likely coccoid bacteria based on their morphological similarity. Within the fecal pellets excreted by the trace-maker of P. burkei, microbially mediated precipitation of Fe and Mn minerals probably occurred on or just near the outer surface of coccoid bacterial cells. Such microbial processes are important in the preservation of invertebrate fecal pellets excreted in shallow tiers, especially under wave- or currentinfluenced shallow-marine sedimentary conditions.

There are known 'parent atop eggs' fossils of nonavian theropod dinosaurs (ancestors to birds), but no equivalent fossil for crocodylians has been reported yet within this context. Here we present a remarkable fossil of an adult crocodylian (Diplocynodon darwini) preserved in situ with eggs from the middle Eocene of Geiseltal, Germany, providing the first-reported evidence for the antiquity of parental care in the crocodylian lineage. The degree of articulation, the unusual curled posture of the adult, the position of the eggs, and the surrounding sediment indicate the adult may have died atop its nest after oviposition. Size relationships between the adult and eggs are consistent with values from modern related taxa and no other crocodylian was found within 12 m of the eggs. Thorough documentation of fossil vertebrate skeletons collected near the fossil crocodylian does not indicate flow influenced its curled posture. Despite being sexually mature, the adult crocodylian did not exhibit full fusion of the neurocentral sutures, an indicator of immaturity in nonavian archosaurs. Even in a paratropic environment, temperatures may temporarily drop below cold tolerance for warm-adapted crocodylians, possibly explaining the death of the adult and the young inside the eggs. Although still indicating egg attendance, the fossil may alternatively indicate the mother died from dystocia (egg-binding) during oviposition, which would be to our knowledge the first published record of this rare phenomenon in a fossil archosaur. © 2015 SEPM (Society for Sedimentary Geology).",,adult;

The egg capsules were attached to the inner side of the shell wall of empty body chambers of two ammonites. Due to phosphatization, the egg capsules retained their original morphology preserving both the lower attachment base and upper hemispherical cover. Comparison with recent and fossil gastropod egg capsules indicates that these were not produced by neritimorphs, the egg capsules of which are known from the Lower Jurassic and Upper Cretaceous. Since these fossil egg capsules share many similarities with those produced by some recent rissoids and muricid neogastropods, it is evident that they were produced by some representatives of Caenogastropoda. The abundant filamentous microbial structures, as well as micron-sized apatite globules, preserved inside the egg capsules suggest that phosphatization processes were mediated by microbial consortia under anaerobic and low-pH conditions. © 2015 SEPM (Society for Sedimentary Geology).",,ammonite; anoxic conditions; apatite; Cretaceous; egg; fossil; gastropod; Jurassic; morphology; shell; Russian Federation; Caenogastropoda; Gastropoda; Muricidae; Neogastropoda; Neritopsina; Rissoidae,,,,,,,"Adegoke, O.S., Dessauvagie, T.F.J., Yoloye, V.L.A., Hemisphaeramminalike egg capsules of Neritina (Gastropoda) from Nigeria (1969) Micropaleontology, 15, pp. 102-106; Aktipis, S.W., Giribet, G., Lindberg, D.R., Ponder, W.F., Gastropoda: An overview and analysis (2008) Phylogeny and Evolution of the Mollusca, pp. 201-238. , Ponder, W.F., and Lindberg, D.R., eds., Berkeley and Los Angeles, University of California Press; Bandel, K., Morphologie und Bildung der frühontogenetischen Gehäuse bei conchiferen Mollusken (1982) Facies, 7, pp. 1-198; Baranov, V.N., On the egg remains in the body chambers of the late Volgian ammonites (1985) Bulletin of the Moscow Society of Naturalists, Series Geology, 60, pp. 89-91. , [In Russian]; Bigatti, G., Giraud-Billoud, M., Vega, I.A., Penchaszadeh, P.E., Castrovasquez, A., The calcareous egg capsules of the Patagonian neogastropod Odontocymbiola magellanica: Morphology, secretion and mineralogy (2010) Journal of Molluscan Studies, 76, pp. 279-288; Briggs, D.E.G., Kear, A.J., Decay and mineralization of shrimps (1994) PALAIOS, 9, pp. 431-456; Briggs, D.E.G., Wilby, P.R., The role of the calcium carbonate-calcium phosphate switch in the mineralization of soft-bodied fossils (1996) Journal of the Geological Society, London, 153, pp. 665-668; Briggs, D.E.G., Moore, R.A., Schultz, J.W., Schweigert, G., Mineralization of soft-part anatomy and invading microbes in the horseshoe crab Mesolimulus from the Upper Jurassic Lagerstätte of Nusplingen, Germany (2005) Royal Society, Proceedings, B, 272, pp. 627-632; Chafetz, H.S., Buczynski, C., Bacterially induced lithification of microbial mats (1992) PALAIOS, 7, pp. 277-293; Conti, M.A., Monari, S., Oliverio, M., Early rissoid gastropods from the Jurassic of Italy: The meaning of first appearances (1993) Scripta Geologica, (2), pp. 67-74; Cosmidis, J., Benzerara, K., Gheerbrant, E., Esteve, I., Bouya, B., Andamaghzaz, M., Nanometer-scale characterization of exceptionally preserved bacterial fossils in Paleocene phosphorites from Ouled Abdoun (Morocco) (2013) Geobiology, 11, pp. 139-153; Cunningham, J.A., Thomas, C.-W., Bengtson, S., Marone, F., Stampanoni, M., Turner, F.R., Bailey, J.V., Donoghue, P.C.J., Experimental taphonomy of giant sulphur bacteria: Implications for the interpretation of the embryo-like Ediacaran Doushantuo fossils (2012) Royal Society, Proceedings, B, 279, pp. 1857-1864; D'Asaro, C.N., Egg capsules of eleven marine prosobranchs from northwest Florida (1986) Bulletin of Marine Science, 39, pp. 76-91; D'Asaro, C.N., Gunnar Thorson's world-wide collection of prosobranch egg capsules: Murricidae (1991) Ophelia, 35, pp. 1-101; D'Asaro, C.N., Gunnar Thorson's world-wide collection of prosobranch egg capsules: Melongenidae (1997) Ophelia, 46, pp. 83-125; D'Asaro, C.N., Gunnar Thorson's world-wide collection of prosobranch egg capsules: Fasciolariidae (2000) Ophelia, 52, pp. 77-112; Fraaije, R.H.B., The oldest in situ hermit crab from the Lower Cretaceous of Speeton, UK (2003) Palaeontology, 46, pp. 53-57; Fukumori, H., Chee, S.Y., Kano, Y., Drilling predation on neritid egg capsules by the muricid snail Reishia clavigera (2013) Journal of Molluscan Studies, 79, pp. 139-146; Graham, A., Molluscs: Prosobranch and pyramidellid gastropods (1988) Synopses of the British Fauna, 662p. , Kermack, D.M., and Barnes, R.S.K., eds., (New Series) No. 2 (2d ed.): Leiden, Published for the Linnean Society of London and The Estuarine and Brackish-Water Sciences Association by E.J.

A series of flume studies was conducted to establish analytical techniques for assessing eggshell hydraulic transport in the fossil record. We investigated preferred eggshell orientation after transport, the relationship of flow competence with eggshell height and volume, and the size of clastic sediment expected to be associated with transported eggshells. Goose, emu, and ostrich eggshell fragments were released in a flume with decelerating flow. The transport of each eggshell was observed five times on each of four substrates (coarse sand, sparse gravel, dense gravel, and polyvinyl chloride). At eggshell deposition, eggshell orientation and flow depths were recorded. Critical bed shear stress for eggshell deposition was estimated based on the flow depth at the point of eggshell deposition, tested relative to eggshell height and volume, and used to estimate the size of hydraulically equivalent particles. The probability of concave-down orientation after transport was > 85% regardless of eggshell type or substrate. The bed shear stress at eggshell deposition reflected the eggshell height and volume. The estimated size of hydraulically equivalent particles was coarse sand or larger. A high proportion of concave-down eggshells in a fossil assemblage may indicate transport. In addition, eggshells may be sorted according to their height and volume. Coarse sand or larger particles observed in a matrix of fossil eggshells may suggest eggshell transport. © 2015, SEPM (Society for Sedimentary Geology).",,clastic sediment; eggshell; floodplain; fossil record;

In contrast, we investigate a uniquely extensive and microstratigraphically spatially uniform interval of upper Famennian (Upper Devonian) marginal marine strata in the Rocky Mountains. This transgressive deposit (< 5 m thick) rests on a depositional sequence boundary, and is composed of a thin, discontinuous basal transgressive sandstone bed, two thin fossiliferous shale beds, and several meters of oncolite-bearing carbonate wackestone. The lower shale is a consistently thin (∼ 0.1 m) bed with a fossil fauna of spinicaudatans (clam shrimp or conchostracans), which are extant, bivalved, chitinous, benthic crustaceans that live in fresh to brackish water, in ephemeral ponds, estuaries, and other shoreline settings. Isotopic data for the oncolitic unit record deposition in an epicontinental seaway with restricted circulation and locally brackish conditions. Sulfur isotope data may also reflect short-term changes in redox conditions, consistent with our interpretation of temporary hypoxia during deposition of the spinicaudatan bed, based on its faunal assemblages. The remarkably large areal extent (∼ 1600 km north to south, and ∼ 1000 km east to west) of this uniformly thin interval with marginal marine fauna is one of the most unusual paleoecological events of the latest Devonian in Laurentia. It is considered an artifact of exceptional depositional processes including passive transgression (i.e., little or no wave or tidal ravinement) along with rapid opportunistic takeover of habitats during transgression. The radiation, possibly associated with temporary hypoxia, was aided by the spinicaudatan reproductive strategy of numerous offspring, high growth rate, and rapid reproduction. © 2015 SEPM (Society for Sedimentary Geology).",,biostratigraphy; depositional environment; depositional sequence; facies; Famennian; fossil assemblage; invertebrate; isotopic analysis; Laurentia; marine ecosystem; preservation; shale; spatial distribution; transgression; Rocky Mountains; Conchostraca; Crustacea,,,,,,,"Allen, G.P., Posamentier, H.W., Sequence stratigraphy and facies model of an incised valley fill: The Gironde estuary, France (1993) Journal of Sedimentary Petrology, 63, pp. 378-391; Aller, R.C., Madrid, V., Chistoserdov, A., Aller, J.Y., Heilbrun, C., Unsteady diagenetic processes and sulfur biogeochemistry in tropical deltaic muds: Implications for oceanic isotope cycles and the sedimentary record (2010) Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta, 74, pp. 4671-4692; Becker, R.T., Anoxia, eustatic changes, and Upper Devonian to lowermost Carboniferous global ammonoid diversity (1993) The Ammonoidea: Environment, Ecology, and Evolutionary Change, 47, pp. 115-164. , House, M.R., ed., Systematics Association; Brett, C.E., McLaughlin, P.I., Baird, G.C., Eo-Ulrichian to Neo-Ulrichian views: The renaissance of ""layer-cake stratigraphy"" (2007) Stratigraphy, 4, pp. 201-216; Bruun, P., Sea level rise as a cause of shore erosion (1962) Journal of Waterways and Harbors, Division, American Society Proceedings, 88, pp. 117-130; Buggisch, W., Joachimski, M.M., Carbon isotope stratigraphy of the Devonian of central and southern Europe (2006) Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, 240, pp. 66-88; Burdett, J.W., Arthur, M.A., Richardson, M., A Neogene seawater sulfur isotope age curve from calcareous pelagic microfossils (1989) Earth and Planetary Science Letters, 94, pp. 189-198; Canfield, D.E., Biogeochemistry of sulfur isotopes: Reviews in Mineralogy and Geochemistry (2001) Stable Isotope Geochemistry, 43, pp. 607-636; Canfield, D.E., Teske, A., Late Proterozoic rise in atmospheric oxygen concentration inferred from phylogenetic and sulphur-isotope studies (1996) Nature, 382, pp. 127-132; Canfield, D.E., Raiswell, R., Westrich, J.T., Reaves, C.M., Berner, R.A., The use of chromium reduction in the analysis of reduced inorganic sulphur in sediments and shale (1986) Chemical Geology, 54, pp. 149-155; Caswell, B.A., Coe, A.L., A high-resolution shallow marine record of the Toarcian (Early Jurassic) Oceanic Anoxic Event from the East Midlands Shelf, UK (2012) Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, 365-366, pp. 124-135; Caswell, B.A., Coe, A.L., Primary productivity controls on opportunistic bivalves during Early Jurassic oceanic deoxygenation (2013) Geology, 41, pp. 1163-1166; Cattaneo, A., Steel, R.J., Transgressive deposits: A review of their variability (2003) Earth-Science Reviews, 62, pp. 187-228; Cole, D., Myrow, P.M., Fike, D.A., Hakim, A., Gehrels, G.E., Uppermost Devonian (Famennian) to Lower Mississippian events of the western U.S.: Stratigraphy, sedimentology, chemostratigraphy, and detrital zircon geochronology (2015) Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, 427, pp. 1-19; Dalrymple, R.W., Zaitlin, B.A., Boyd, R., Estuarine facies models: Conceptual basis and stratigraphic implications (1992) Journal of Sedimentary Petrology, 62, pp. 1130-1146; Dalrymple, R.W., Boyd, R., Zaitlin, B.A., Incised-valley systems: Origin and sedimentary sequences (1994) SEPM (Society for Sedimentary Geology), 51, 391p. , Special Publication; Diaz, R.J., Overview of hypoxia around the world (2001) Journal of Environmental Quality, 30, pp. 275-281; Eppley, R.W., Rogers, J.N., McCarthy, J.J., Half saturation constants for uptake of nitrate and ammonium by marine phytoplankton (1969) Limnology and Oceanography, 14, pp. 912-920; Eriksen, C.H., Brown, R.J., Comparative respiratory physiology and ecology of Phyllopod Crustacea: I.

In BSE imaging, contrast corresponds to differences in backscattering of primary electrons and BSE detection among points in the electron beam raster scan. In general, BSE images are known for compositional contrast corresponding to backscattering monotonically related to average atomic number. However, two other types of contrast are relevant to BSE-SEM of fossils: (1) topographic contrast corresponding to backscattering and BSE detection varying with specimen shape and (2) mass-thickness contrast corresponding to backscattering varying with the relative masses and thicknesses of materials in the uppermost few microns of a sample. Here, we demonstrate the significance of these contrast mechanisms for resolving three-dimensional and subsurficial features of fossils. First, we show-through study of mass-thickness contrast in BSE images of carbonaceous compressions from the Triassic Solite Quarry Lagerstätte (Virginia)-that some tissues (e.g., leaf and insect wing veins) are preserved as thicker carbonaceous films than others (e.g., leaf laminae and insect wing membranes), possibly reflecting taphonomic differences among anatomical tissues. Second, we show that the problematic phosphatic shelly fossil Sphenothallus (lower Cambrian, China) is covered by low-relief transverse ribs and made up of exteriorly sculptured and interiorly unsculptured carbon- and phosphorus-rich layers with microstructures. Taking advantage of both topographic and mass-thickness contrast mechanisms, these case studies demonstrate that BSE imaging elucidates morphological details that are not obvious in surficial light microscopy or secondary-electron SEM and are otherwise only evident via tomography. © 2015 SEPM (Society for Sedimentary Geology).",,backscatter;

As with most exceptionally preserved fossils, key anatomical features in non-biomineralized chordate fossils are often preserved in less than pristine condition, and potentially only a subset of those originally present. How taphonomic processes impacted on the anatomy of fossils can be constrained by experimental decay of extant analogues. We experimentally decayed tadpoles of Xenopus laevis to document the rate at which various nonbiomineralized tissues degrade and identify changes over time in their ultrastructure. Tissues decayed under identical conditions and sampled at the same time often differed in the level of ultrastructural detail. This is termed an inconsistent pattern of decay and introduces unpredictable taphonomic noise to any dataset. We integrated these results with data from anuran tadpole fossils from the Miocene of Spain and confirm that the nerve cord is less decay resistant than the notochord. Only the notochord is likely to be preserved organically. The nerve cord is only likely to be preserved if replicated in authigenic minerals (calcium phosphate). This is more likely than for other extremely decay-prone tissues, a result of the nerve cord's chemistry in vivo. Two tissues of similar recalcitrance do not, therefore, have equal fossilization potential. On the basis of the experimental and fossil data, structures preserved in amphibians from the Permian Saar-Nahe Basin of Germany are interpreted as fossilized nerve cords, not notochords. © Copyright 2015 SEPM (Society for Sedimentary Geology).",,anatomy; biochemistry; cells and cell components; degradation; developmental stage; experimental study; fossil record; frog; Miocene; Permian; taphonomy; ultrastructure; Germany; Saar-Nahe Basin; Spain; Amphibia; Chordata; Xenopus laevis,,,,,,,"Aldridge, R.J., Hou, X.-G., Siveter, D.J., Gabbott, S.E., The systematics and phylogenetic relationships of vetulicolians (2007) Palaeontology, 50, pp. 131-168; Barkow, P.S., Babcock, E., Turning pyrite concretions outside-in: Role of biofilms in pyritization of fossils (2003) Sedimentary Record, 1, pp. 4-7; Briggs, D.E.G., Kear, A.J., Fossilization of soft tissue in the laboratory (1993) Science, 259, pp. 1439-1442; Briggs, D.E.G., Kear, A.J., Decay and mineralization of shrimps (1994) PALAIOS, 9, pp. 431-456; Brunelli, E., Perrotta, E., Tripepi, S., Ultrastructure and development of the gills in Rana dalmatina (Amphibia, Anura) (2004) Zoomorphology, 123, pp. 203-211; Bruns, R.D., Gross, J., Studies on the tadpole tail: 1.

However, the timing and mechanism(s) of framboid formation on bone remain poorly understood. To better constrain the initial formation of framboids during decomposition of bone in marine depositional environments, we simulated aspects of bone decay on the ocean floor and analyzed framboids found on bone surfaces and in the associated sediment. We observed that framboids formed on bone surfaces within one week of experimentation, and were associated with reducing conditions within a dark-colored microbial mat overlain by oxic waters. Statistical and discriminant analyses of elemental data show that bone-hosted framboids formed in situ on the bone surfaces. Close associations of framboids with sulfidic microbial biofilms indicate that bone-hosted framboids resulted from conditions generated during the microbial degradation of bone-associated organic matter. Our results suggest that framboids can form on bone surfaces while bones rest on the seafloor prior to burial and perhaps prior to the so-called sulphophilic stage of whale-fall animal colonization. We compared experimentally produced framboids with published sedimentary framboid populations. Bone-hosted framboids resemble smaller and less variably sized sedimentary framboid populations canonically known to form in anoxic water columns, even though the bone-hosted framboids were overlain by oxygenated conditions. We propose that the period available for framboid growth is shorter on bone surfaces than in sediments, because geochemical conditions that favor sulfide mineral precipitation on bone are transient. Shorter growing periods and localized conditions result in smaller framboid sizes that may not reflect ambient conditions in a water column. © Copyright 2015 SEPM (Society for Sedimentary Geology).",,anoxic conditions; biodegradation; biofilm; bone; depositional environment; discriminant analysis; marine environment; microbial activity; micromorphology; organic matter; seafloor; sulfide; taphonomy; water column; whale; Animalia; Cetacea,,,,,,,"Allison, P.A., Taphonomy of the Eocene London clay biota (1988) Palaeontology, 31, pp. 1079-1100; Amano, K., Little, C.T., Miocene whale-fall community from Hokkaido, northern Japan (2005) Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, 215, pp. 345-356; Amano, K., Little, C.T., Inoue, K., A new Miocene whale-fall community from Japan (2007) Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, 247, pp. 236-242; Amon, D.J., Glover, A.G., Wiklund, H., Marsh, L., Linse, K., Rogers, A.D., Copley, J.T., The discovery of a natural whale fall in the Antarctic deep sea: Deep Sea research Part II (2013) Topical Studies in Oceanography, 92, pp. 87-96; Berner, R.A., The synthesis of framboidal pyrite (1969) Economic Geology, 64, pp. 383-384; Berner, R.A., Sedimentary pyrite formation (1970) American Journal of Science, 268, pp. 1-23; Bond, D., Wignall, P.B., Racki, G., Extent and duration of marine anoxia during the Frasnian-Famennian (Late Devonian) mass extinction in Poland, Germany, Austria and France (2004) Geological Magazine, 141, pp. 173-193; Brett, C.E., Baird, G.C., Comparative taphonomy: A key to paleoenvironmental interpretation based on fossil preservation (1986) PALAIOS, 1, pp. 207-227; Canfield, D.E., Raiswell, R., Pyrite formation and fossil preservation (1991) Taphonomy: Releasing the Data Locked in the Fossil Record, 9, pp. 337-387. , New York: Plenum Press, 1991; Darroch, S.A., Laflamme, M., Schiffbauer, J.D., Briggs, D.E., Experimental formation of a microbial death mask (2012) PALAIOS, 27, pp. 293-303; Deming, J.W., Reysenbach, A.L., MacKo, S.A., Smith, C.R., Evidence for the microbial basis of a chemoautotrophic invertebrate community at a whale fall on the deep seafloor: Bone-colonizing bacteria and invertebrate endosymbionts (1997) Microscopy Research and Technique, 37, pp. 162-170; Donald, R., Southam, G., Low temperature anaerobic bacterial diagenesis of ferrous monosulfide to pyrite (1999) Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta, 63, pp. 2019-2023; Farrand, M., Framboidal sulphides precipitated synthetically (1970) Mineralium Deposita, 5, pp. 237-247; Giancamillo, A.D., Giudici, E., Andreola, S., Porta, D., Gibelli, D., Domeneghini, C., Grandi, M., Cattaneo, C., Immersion of piglet carcasses in water: The applicability of microscopic analysis and limits of diatom testing on an animal model (2010) Legal Medicine, 12, pp. 13-18; Grimes, S.T., Brock, F., Rickard, D., Davies, K.L., Edwards, D., Briggs, D.E., Parkes, R.J., Understanding fossilization: Experimental pyritization of plants (2001) Geology, 29, pp. 123-126; Grimes, S.T., Davies, K.L., Butler, I.B., Brock, F., Edwards, D., Rickard, D., Briggs, D.E., Parkes, R.J., Fossil plants from the Eocene London Clay: The use of pyrite textures to determine the mechanism of pyritization (2002) Journal of the Geological Society, 159, pp. 493-501; Hollund, H., Jans, M., Collins, M., Kars, H., Joosten, I., Kars, S., What happened here?

There, relative sea-level fluctuations led to the formation of transgressive-regressive sequences, exposed in open-cast lignite mines in the area of Helmstedt (Lower Saxony, Germany), which record environmental changes at the marine-terrestrial interface. We studied an example from the middle Eocene of the Helmstedt Mine from which we reconstruct ecological successions from open estuary to meandering river environments, which represent vegetation at the Paleogene climatic optimum. In the absence of vertebrate and shelly fossils, environmental interpretations are made exclusively on plant matter in the sediment. Vegetational reconstructions are based mainly on quantitative palynological analyses, supported by paleobotanical and organic-petrographical evidence and confirmed by Principal Component Analysis. Diverse dinocyst assemblages in conjunction with Ophiomorpha-type bioturbation indicate open estuarine conditions. These are succeeded by mangrove, represented by pollen of Rhizophora, Avicennia, Nypa and the form species Psilodiporites iszkaszentgoergyi, and marsh environments, indicated by pollen of Restionaceae, Sparganiaceae/Typhaceae and fern spores. Subsequent lowland mire forests are characterized by a dominance of either the Tricolporopollenites cingulum group (Fagaceae) or triporate pollen of the Triporopollenites robustus/rhenanus complex (Myricaceae/Betulaceae). Within this landscape coexists a meandering river system, represented by channel lag and point-bar deposits of the active channel and by the clastic to lignitic sedimentary fill of an abandoned channel. © Copyright 2015 SEPM (Society for Sedimentary Geology).",,depositional environment; dinoflagellate cyst; ecological approach; environmental change; Eocene; estuary; greenhouse ecosystem; ichnology; mangrove; meander; monocotyledon; open water; opencast mining; palynology; reconstruction; river water; transgression-regression cycle; Atlantic Ocean; Germany; Helmstedt; Lower Saxony; North Sea; Avicennia; Fagaceae; Filicophyta; Nypa; Restionaceae; Rhizophora; Vertebrata,,,,,,,"Ahrendt, H., Köthe, A., Lietzow, A., Marheine, D., Ritzkowski, S., Lithostratigraphie, Biostratigraphie und radiometrische Datierung des Unter-Eozäns von Helmstedt (SE-Niedersachsen) (1995) Zeitschrift der Deutschen Geologischen Gesellschaft, 146, pp. 450-457; Akkiraz, M.S., Kayseri, M.S., Akgün, F., Palaeoecology of coal-bearing Eocene sediments in central Anatolia (Turkey) based on quantitative palynological data (2008) Turkish Journal of Earth Science, 17, pp. 317-360; Archibald, S.B., Greenwood, D.R., The Okanagan Highlands: Eocene biota, environments and geological setting, southern British Columbia, Canada and northeastern Washington, USA (2005) Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences, 42, pp. 111-114; Behrensmeyer, A.K., Hook, R.W., Paleoenvironmental contexts and taphonomic modes (1992) Terrestrial Ecosystems Through Time, pp. 1-13. , Behrensmeyer, A.K., Damuth, J.D., DiMichele, W.A., Potts, R., Sues, H.-D., and Wing, S.L., eds., Chicago and London, University of Chicago Press; Bianchi, T.S., Estuaries: Where the river meets the sea (2013) Nature Education Knowledge, 4 (4), pp. 1-6; Blumenstengel, H., Krutzsch, W., Tertiär (2008) Geologie von Sachsen-Anhalt, pp. 267-292. , Bachmann, G.H., Ehling, B.-C., Eichner, R., and Schwab, M., eds., Stuttgart, E.

The young population is interpreted to record the rapid loss of shells from the taphonomically active zone at or near the sediment surface. The middle-aged population is interpreted to record a sequestered population of shells that has had time to accumulate below the taphonomically active zone. Although surface age spectra differ among depositional environments and at different locations, both of these populations are present in all sampled facies at multiple locations within the bay, indicating that the overarching controls on surface age spectra affect the entire bay. The very old surface population is present only in bay-margin sites and is interpreted to represent shells exhumed from eroding Holocene deposits. An 86-cm-long core taken at a bay-margin site near the mouth of the Aransas River contains shells spanning < 1 to 14,000 years but not preserved in stratigraphic order. The lack of stratigraphic order and the presence of distinct breaks in the postmortem age distribution suggest that 67% of shells in the core were recycled from older deposits, resulting in a 2-3 order of magnitude increase in the amount of time averaging in the sediment column relative to surface samples. © Copyright 2015 SEPM (Society for Sedimentary Geology).",,age structure; bay; bivalve; burial (geology); depositional environment; estuarine sediment; historical record; Holocene; population distribution; sediment analysis; shell; stratigraphy; young population; Aransas Bay; Copano Bay; Texas; United States; Bivalvia; Mulinia lateralis,,,,,,,"Allen, A.P., Kosnik, M.A., Kaufman, D.S., Characterizing the dynamics of amino acid racemization using time-dependent reaction kinetics: A Bayesian approach to fitting age-calibration models (2013) Quaternary Geochronology, 18, pp. 63-77; Aller, R.C., Carbonate dissolution in nearshore terrigenous muds: The role of physical and biological reworking (1982) Journal of Geology, 90, pp. 79-95; Anderson, J.B., Rodriguez, A.B., Response of upper gulf coast estuaries to holocene climate change and sea-level rise (2008) Geological Society of America Special Papers, 443, p. 146; Bentley, S.J., Sheremet, A., New model for the emplacement, bioturbation, and preservation of fine-scaled sedimentary strata (2003) Geology, 31, pp. 725-728; Bolker, B.M., (2008) Ecological Models and Data in R, p. 396. , Princeton, New Jersey, Princeton University Press; Boudreau, B.P., Mathematics of tracer mixing in sediments: I.

We report recently discovered macroscopic organic warty sheets (MOWS) in macerates of limestone from the ca. 662-635 Ma Taishir Formation (Tsagaan Olom Group, Mongolia). Sheets are applanate. One surface contains raised ridges and conspicuous, ∼ 100-μm-tall warty protuberances with depressed tops that enclose internal cavities containing cellular structures. The Taishir MOWS may be the remains of unusual bacterial, protistan, or fungal biofilms, or a previously undocumented, extinct taxon. However, multiple lines of evidence including the morphology of warty protuberances and the presence of cellular architecture within protuberances support the interpretation of MOWS as marine algae, perhaps a member of the Rhodophyta. Regardless of their specific taxonomic affiliation, MOWS increase the diversity of biota reported from the Cryogenian glacial interlude and indicate the presence of macroscopic and morphologically complex multicellular organisms in the Cryogenian. © Copyright 2015 SEPM (Society for Sedimentary Geology).",,carbonate; eukaryote; fossil record; limestone; marine environment; morphology; Proterozoic; red alga; taphonomy; taxonomy; Mongolia; algae; Bacteria (microorganisms); Eukaryota; Protista; Rhodophyta,,,,,,,"Adey, W.H., Townsend, R.A., Boykins, W.T., The crustose coralline algae (Rhodophyta: Corallinaceae) of the Hawaiian Islands (1982) Smithsonian Contributions to the Marine Sciences, 74p; Avila, M., Candia, A., Nuñez, M., Romo, H., Reproductive biology of Gigartina skottsbergii (Gigartinaceae, Rhodophyta) from Chile (1999) Hydrobiologia, 398, pp. 149-157; Bassi, D., Nebelsick, J.H., Calcareous algae from the lower Oligocene Gornji Grad Beds of northern Slovenia (2000) Rivista Italiana di Paleontologia e Stratigrafia, 106, pp. 99-122; Bold, U., MacDonald, F.A., Smith, E.F., Crowly, J.C., Minjin, C., Elevating the Neoproterozoic Tsagaan-Olom Formation to a Group (2013) Mongolian Geoscientist, 39, pp. 89-94; Bosak, T., Liang, B., Sim, M.S., Petroff, A.P., Morphological record of oxygenic photosynthesis in conical stromatolites (2009) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 106 (27), pp. 10939-10943; Bosak, T., Bush, J.W.M., Flynn, M.R., Liang, B., Ono, S., Petroff, A.P., Sim, M.S., Formation and stability of oxygen-rich bubbles that shape photosynthetic mats (2010) Geobiology, 8 (1), pp. 45-55; Bosak, T., Lahr, D.J.G., Pruss, S.B., MacDonald, F.A., Dalton, L., Matys, E., Agglutinated tests in post-Sturtian cap carbonates of Namibia and Mongolia (2011) Earth and Planetary Science Letters, 308 (1-2), pp. 29-40; Bosak, T., MacDonald, F., Lahr, D., Matys, E., Putative Cryogenian ciliates from Mongolia (2011) Geology, 39 (12), pp. 1123-1126; Bosak, T., Lahr, D.J.G., Pruss, S.B., MacDonald, F.A., Gooday, A.J., Dalton, L., Matys, E.D., Possible early foraminiferans in post-Sturtian (716-635 Ma) cap carbonates (2011) Geology, 40 (1), pp. 67-70; Bosak, T., Knoll, A.H., Petroff, A.P., The meaning of stromatolites (2013) Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences, 41 (1), pp. 21-44; Braga, J.C., Aguirre, J., Taxonomy of fossil coralline algal species: Neogene Lithophylloideae (Rhodophyta, Corallinaceae) from southern Spain (1995) Review of Palaeobotany and Palynology, 86 (3), pp. 265-285; Brain, C.K.B., Prave, A.R., Hoffmann, K.-H., Fallick, A.E., Botha, A., Herd, D.A., Sturrock, C., Allison, S.G., The first animals: Ca. 760-million-year-old sponge-like fossils from Namibia (2012) South African Journal of Science, 108 (1-2); Brown, M.W., Kolisko, M., Silberman, J.D., Roger, A.J., Aggregative multicellularity evolved independently in the eukaryotic supergroup Rhizaria (2012) Current Biology, 22 (12), pp. 1123-1127; Butterfield, N.J., Bangiomorpha pubescens n.

In contrast to marine settings, actualistic taphonomic studies are lacking for shell-rich concentrations in freshwater riverine systems. In particular, the taphonomic pathways and the origins of taphonomic signatures that are recorded in bioclasts from fluvial settings are poorly known. In this study, we addressed this issue by comparing the taphonomic signatures and shell-damage profiles among shells of freshwater mollusks recorded both in death and in fossil assemblages from the same fluvial environment. Our data indicated that dissolution was the most pervasive taphonomic process leading to the destruction of the shells. The loss of taphonomic information extended beyond shell dissolution in the riverbed, or the early diagenesis in the sedimentary record. The loss of biological information from the living community through the death assemblage, until the incorporation of shells as fossils, mainly occurred during the time the shells were in the sediment-water interface. Though this destruction affected primarily dead shells, reworked fossils also became vulnerable because they were carried out into the river load again by channel avulsion. A model that included the main taphonomic pathways followed by the molluscan shells in the fluvial Touro Passo Formation (Pleistocene-Holocene) is discussed. In this model, two main destructive domains were recognized, which were the biological, physical, and chemical processes operating at the taphonomically active zone (=TAZ domain) and the pedogenetic domain.

In this study, vertebrate fossils from Upper Cretaceous formations of Alabama were analyzed to determine if REE analyses could be equally effective at resolving taphonomic and paleoenvironmental questions in marine carbonate strata. Results indicate that these fossils possess unique REE signatures, although they are not as distinctive as those of siliciclastic formations. REE data can also be used, with limitations, for stratigraphic assignment of vertebrate fossils as well as indicating relative paleobathymetry. Furthermore, differences in REE signatures between certain taxonomic groups and REE concentrations in different osteological material are observed. In conclusion, findings herein indicate that REE analysis of vertebrate fossils from carbonate deposits can be effective for paleoenvironmental and regional paleogeographic studies.

In order to determine the controls on exceptional fossilization within concretions, we scored 88 concretion-bearing sites for 11 environmental and compositional variables together with presence/absence of soft-tissue preservation and analyzed their relationships using multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) and qualitative logistic regression. Sites yielding exceptional fossils were distributed randomly through the 88 examples considered, suggesting that exceptional preservation can occur in almost any environment where concretions form. The patterns of interaction of the variables in the MCA revealed that the most important factors controlling exceptional preservation in concretions are related to (1) the potential for fossil preservation in the broader depositional setting (i.e., how likely fossils are to be preserved without concretions but in the same depositional environment) and (2) the rate of concretion growth. In an analysis of the contribution of individual variables, logistic regression showed that two features correlate with the presence of soft-tissue preservation in concretions: (1) fine-grained host lithology, and (2) relatively constant δ 13C values. The role of the first of these can be tested experimentally. Decay experiments on fish tissue in glass beads of three different sizes and therefore of different permeability showed that decay is inhibited, and mineral precipitation enhanced, in low-permeability sediments. Thus a process of positive feedback promotes exceptional preservation where early cementation results in a rapid decrease in permeability during concretion formation.

This study describes and analyzes the degree of preservation of shells of both species recovered from nine Holocene localities in order to describe and quantify taphonomic alterations, evaluate if preservation varied during the Holocene, and assess their utility as paleoenvironmental bioindicators. Heleobia parchappii displayed better overall preservation than H. australis, with little evidence of fragmentation, limited principally to levels with highest densities. On a temporal scale, no significant differences in fragmentation were found, whereas corrasion and luster displayed temporal differences.

Zoophycos from both regions is composed of a marginal tube and a tongue-like spreiten complex, the latter itself consisting of primary lamellae in planar view and backfill structures (dark and light menisci) in cross-sectional view. The Zoophycos tracemaker is interpreted to have periodically collected and fed on the surrounding nutrient-enriched sediments within a shallow depth of the seafloor. The dark menisci may correspond to the burrowing phase, whereas the light menisci may be related to a multiple-behavior phase, including dwelling, feeding, farming, resting, and excreting. Symbiotic microorganisms (e.g., sulphate-reducing bacteria) may have been closely involved with the Zoophycos tracemaker in producing the complex structures of the spreiten, based on the abundant pyrite framboids that were found in the Zoophycos spreiten. We suggest that Zoophycos is not simply a biogenic sedimentary structure formed by the motion of the tracemaker; rather it represents a set of complex and elaborate biogenic structures formed by a succession of life behaviors of the tracemaker along with its symbiotic microorganisms. The complete formative process of Zoophycos is reconstructed and linked to its morphology, based on this interpretation.

The exceptionally well-preserved mollusks include aragonite-calcite pairs precipitated by individual belemnite animals that enable an assessment of possible ""vital"" effects and the reliability of using belemnite calcite to determine ocean water compositions. The oxygen isotope data derived from the calcitic rostra of the belemnites (Cylindroteuthis) show modest variability, ranging from 21.2 to 0.9%o (V-PDB), while their accompanying aragonitic phragmocones range from 21.4 to 0.0%o. Data derived from the ammonite Kosmoceras show some scatter, with oxygen isotope values varying from 23.6 to 20.2%o. The aragonite data from Cylindroteuthis, Kosmoceras and Belemnotheutis all overlap, suggesting they inhabited similar (surface) water depths. However, the corresponding data from the calcitic rostra of the Cylindroteuthis specimens suggest temperatures, 5°C cooler. As we have analyzed aragonite-calcite pairs, the discrepancy cannot be explained by environmental effects. Though clearly a vital effect, it is difficult to resolve whether the temperatures derived from the aragonite (phragmocone) are too warm or from the calcite (rostrum) are too cool. Consequently, the applicability of standard paleotemperature equations to Cylindroteuthid belemnite rostra remains unproven. Sequentially sampled ontogenetic isotope data derived from Belemnotheutis phragmocones reveal only modest δ18O variation, consistent with limited movement between warmer (shallower) and cooler (deeper) waters. A coincidental systematic pattern of δ13C enrichment may signal changes in metabolic activity associated with a shift in ecology or feeding with age.

However, analysis of an extensively exposed, modern, siliciclastic, intertidal hardground community near Thomas Cove, located at Economy Point, Nova Scotia, within the Bay of Fundy, reveals a diverse community of boring, encrusting, and squatting/clinging organisms and a diverse assemblage of sedimentary structures. A high diversity of biota and low diversity, but high abundance, of borings is present along this modern Trypanites-type ichnofacies. Species richness reaches 37 organisms within the study area, and two boring bivalves (Petricola pholadiformis and Zirfaea pilsbryi), which produce Gastrochaenolites-like traces, are present. Eleven distinct depositional subenvironments are identified and are categorized as being either Trypanites-bearing or Trypanites-barren. Analysis of this modern analogue suggests that ancient Trypanites ichnofacies may have been more dynamic and diverse environments than is sometimes interpreted from the rock record.

They are preserved in a sandstone block of the transition unit between the Nájera and Haro Formations from the Ebro Basin. This level is positioned in the Y2 local zone (MN2), of Agenian age (early Miocene). The footprints are small, tridactyl or tetradactyl, with slender and proximally unconnected digit impressions. They have phalangeal pads and claw marks, and there is no evidence of a web or metatarsal pad. The footprints are compared with other shorebird-like ichnotaxa and assigned to the Cretaceous ichnotaxon Koreanaornis isp., which is herein identified for the first time in the Cenozoic. Other shorebird-like footprints from the late Eocene to early Miocene in the Ebro Basin and the early Miocene ichnotaxa Aviadactyla media and Aviadactyla vialovi are also related to this ichnotaxon. In addition to the shorebird-like footprints, the Cenicero tracksite has invertebrate traces and sedimentary and organic structures typical of the Scoyenia ichnofacies, suggesting a mud-dominated floodplain in a centraldistal alluvial fringe as the paleoenvironment. The morphology, habitat, and behavior inferred from the shorebird-like footprints in the Cenicero tracksite are similar to other fossil footprints found in the Mesozoic and Cenozoic as well as to modern shorebird tracks.

Box 9517, Leiden, Netherlands","Larger benthic foraminifera (LBF) show great tolerance to environmental conditions and occur in shallow, tropical marine habitats and depositional settings, including mixed carbonate-siliciclastic (MCS) systems; the latter are characterized by deposition of carbonate producers under the influence of a terrigenous input. In this study, MCS system deposits near Samarinda and Bontang in East Kalimantan (Indonesia) are investigated. These include 10 sections divided into three groups based on their geological age and geographical position: Bontang sections (Burdigalian age), Batu Putih sections (Langhian age), and Stadion sections (Serravallian/Tortonian boundary). Recent studies propose different depositional environments for the studied MCS systems and initiated a need for discrimination among such conflicting interpretations. We apply cluster analysis, detrended correspondence analysis, and analysis of similarity to the LBF assemblage data matrix and interpret the results with predictions from the trophic resource continuum model. The significant differences in LBF diversity and assemblage composition confirm that MCS systems of East Kalimantan developed in differentiated environments. The Batu Putih sections were interpreted to develop in the widest range of depositional environments, from delta front to shelf edge reefs.

The ovipositions may have been produced by insects in the order Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) and are relatively more abundant before than after the Tr-J transition, possibly reflecting changes in plant-insect association. Fossil clitellate annelid (leech) cocoons were also discovered in a macerated sample from a single bed within the Tr-J transition. The cocoons belong to two species: Dictyothylakos pesslerae and Pilothylakos pilosus, extending the range of the latter genus from the Early Cretaceous to the Early Jurassic. This new evidence suggests that the ecosystem and food webs were profoundly affected by the environmental degradation surrounding the end-Triassic event (ETE), which was marked by faunal mass extinctions and floral turnover. Invertebrate ichno- and body fossils may add significantly to paleoenvironmental information provided by plant fossil assemblages, and therefore a protocol for recording evidence of invertebrate activity in paleobotanical research is suggested, including analyzing a standardized number of specimens for fossil traces and bulk maceration for discovery of invertebrate body fossils. More well-designed studies on Mesozoic plant-invertebrate associations are needed and will provide deeper knowledge about the structure and evolution of complex ecosystems. © 2015, SEPM (Society for Sedimentary Geology).",,abundance; cocoon; Cretaceous; damselfly; dragonfly; endophyte; environmental degradation; food web; fossil record; ichnology; Jurassic; leaf; leech; mass extinction; new record; oviposition; plant-insect interaction; range expansion; Triassic; Arctic; Greenland; Jameson Land; Annelida; Ginkgoales; Ginkgoites; Hexapoda; Hirudinida; Invertebrata; Odonata; Sphenobaiera,,,,,,,"Allen, D., Davies, L., Tobin, P., (1984) The Dragonflies of the World: A Systematic List of the Extant Species of Odonata, 1, p. 129. , Societas Internationalis Odonatologica, Rapid Communications, New York, ix +; Bacon, K.L., Belcher, C.M., Haworth, D.M., McElwain, J.C., Increased atmospheric SO2 detected from changes in leaf physiognomy across the Triassic-Jurasic boundary interval of East Greenland (2013) PLOS ONE, 8, p. e60614; Bacon, K.L., Belcher, C.M., Hesselbo, S.P., McElwain, J.C., The Triassic-Jurassic boundary carbon-isotope excursions expressed in taxonomy identified leaf cuticles (2011) PALAIOS, 26, pp. 461-469; Batten, D.J., Palaeoenvironmental implications of plant insect and other organic-walled microfossils in the Weals Clay Formation (Lower Cretaceous) of southeast England (1998) Cretaceous Research, 19, pp. 279-315; Belcher, C.M., Mander, L., Rein, G., Jervis, F.X., Haworth, M., Hesselbo, S.P., Glasspool, I.J., McElwain, J.C., Increased fire activity at the Triassic/Jurassic boundary in Greenland due to climate-driven floral change (2010) Nature Geoscience, 3, pp. 426-429; Benton, M.J., Diversification and extinction in the history of life (1995) Science, 268, pp. 52-58; Bethoux, O., Galtier, J., Nel, A., Earliest evidence of insect endophytic oviposition (2004) PALAIOS, 19, pp. 408-413; Bomfleur, B., Kerp, H., Taylor, T.N., Moestrup, O., Taylor, E.L., Triassic leech cocoon from Antarctica contains fossil bell animal (2012) Proceedings of the National Academy of the Sciences of the United States of America, 109, pp. 20971-20974; Dam, G., Surlyk, F., Forced regression in a large wave- and stormdominated anoxic lake: Kap Stewart Formation (1992) East Greenland: Geology, 20, pp. 748-751; Delucia, E.H., Nabity, P.D., Zavala, J.A., Berenbaum, M.R., Climate change: Resetting plant-insect interactions (2012) Plant Physiology, 160, pp. 1677-1685; Douglas, J.G., The Mesozoic floras of Victoria, Part 3 (1973) Memoirs of the Geological Survey of Victoria, 29, pp. 1-185; Futuyma, D.J., Agrawai, A.A., Macroevolution and the biological diversity of plants and herbivores (2009) Proceedings of the National Academy of the Sciences of the United States of America, 106, pp. 18054-18061; Gnaedinger, S.C., Adami-Rodrigues, K., Gallego, O.F., Endophytic oviposition on leaves from the Late Triassic of northern Chile: Ichnotaxonomic palaeobiogegraphic and palaeoenvironment considerations (2014) Geobios, 47, pp. 221-236; Grauvogel-Stamm, L., Kelber, K.-P., Plant-insect interactions and coevolution during the Triassic in western Europe (1996) Paleontologica Lombardia, 5, pp. 5-23; Grimaldi, D., Engel, M., (2005) Evolution of the Insects, p. 755. , Cambridge University Press, Hong Kong; Hagström, J., Mehlqvist, K., The dawn of terrestrial ecosystems on Baltica: First report on land plant remains and arthropod coprolites from the upper Silurian of Gotland, Sweden (2012) Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, 317-318 C, pp. 162-170; Harris, T.M., The Rhaetic flora of Scoresby Sound, East Greenland (1926) Meddelelser Om Gronland, 682, pp. 1-147; Harris, T.M., The fossil flora of Scoresby Sound, East Greenland.

In this study, micro-CT analyses and sectioning techniques are used for void space assessment, the reconstruction of growth histories, and their related environmental conditions in present-day rhodoliths from Giglio Island (Tyrrhenian Sea, Italy). The rhodoliths are investigated with respect to shape, taxonomy and growth forms of coralline red algae, constructing fauna and flora, degree of porosity, and types of void formation. Porosity within the nodules is calculated using image processing software based on slab surfaces and micro-CT, enabling recognition of different void types at various scales as well as their distribution throughout the rhodoliths. The studied rhodoliths range in sizes from 4 to 16 cm and are spheroidal to sub-spheroidal in shape. The nodules are dominated by coralline red algae and associated with subordinate serpulid worm tubes and bryozoans. Calculated porosity values range from 3 to 41% in volume. Two different types of porosity were distinguished within the rhodoliths: (1) constructional voids are present as primary voids present within single cells and conceptacles and as voids produced by conjoined protuberances of coralline algal thalli, and (2) destructional voids are caused by dissolution and decay of nuclei as well as soft-body organisms and a wide range of bioerosion, including Gastrochaenolites and Trypanites ichnotaxa. The degree of bioerosion (bioerosion index, BI) ranges from low (BI = 2) to moderate (BI = 3).

These rocks contain a rich fossil record even though they have undergone Alpine metamorphism and deformation (350-480°C; 2 Kb). In this paper, we focus on the taphonomic characteristics of the fossil assemblages to infer the depositional processes that can be reconstructed even after metamorphism. The most abundant fossils are crinoids, followed by phacelloid colonial rugose corals, brachiopods, cephalopods (ammonoids and orthoceratids), and possible gastropods and benthic foraminifers. Crinoids occur as isolated columnal ossicles, as well as articulated portions of columns (pluricolumnals). One complete calyx was also found. Taphonomically delicate crinoids are preserved in the calc-silicate schist beds. In the massive marble beds, crinoids occur mostly as disarticulated ossicles, but they still bear delicate ornamental features. Some corals preserve external walls. The low degree of abrasion indicates disarticulation of the crinoids due to exposure in the taphonomic active zone (TAZ), but under low-energy conditions. Articulated crinoids are preserved due to catastrophic burial events. The preservation of the fauna allows the differentiation of background versus event biostratinomic processes even after being highly altered by metamorphism.

By ruling out both local seepage of nonmarine fluids (nonspecialist fauna, normal-marine carbon and oxygen stable isotopes, near PAAS rare earth element distribution patterns) and differential growth rate (bryozoan zooecium size), mound formation is explained by a positive taphonomic feedback mechanism. Centimeter-size patches of automicrite in mound cores are considered crucial in explaining subtle variations of microtexture, microfacies, and subsequent mound formation. Automicrite (M1) is dark gray, contains microbioclasts, has sharply defined, scalloped outer margins, is commonly gravity defying, and occasionally joins up to bridge multiple bryozoan skeletons. Clusters of microtubules are present within M1 and a first generation of infiltrated microcrystalline carbonate sediment (M2). The size, geometry, and arrangement of these microtubules suggest an origin either from the attachment of nonspicular, keratosan sponges, or from the assimilatory action of marine fungi (so-called Wedl tunnels). In conclusion, a subtle and small-scale secondary reinforcement of bryozoan skeletons by cryptobiontic ephemeral substrates is critical for the development of mounds out of an essentially level-bottom bryozoan community.

Strain markers, however, are generally distributed unevenly, and their use can be problematic if strain varies among specimens and the markers do not occur in close association with the fossils. We use two approaches to retrodeform Carboniferous tetrapod tracks from the Narragansett Basin of southern New England: (1) a direct method in which the strain ratio (Rs) is obtained from deformed raindrop imprints preserved on the same specimens as the tracks and (2) an indirect method in which the range in orientation of the bedding-cleavage intersection lineation is used as a proxy for Rs. The latter follows from a strong correlation between the range in orientation of the bedding-cleavage intersection lineation and Rs values obtained from the deformed raindrop imprints, and allows the retrodeformation of tetrapod tracks not preserved in close association with deformed raindrop imprints. Our methodology was applied to both anamniote and amniote traces and was tested by retrodeforming originally bilaterally symmetric insect traces from the same location. In all cases, the trace fossils return to their expected morphology. This work shows that deformed raindrop imprints and bedding-cleavage intersection lineation are useful strain markers for the retrodeformation of trace fossils and expands our understanding of the fossil record of early tetrapods in southern New England.

Two echinoid assemblages dominated by clypeasteroids from the early-middle Miocene of Logudoro region (Northern Sardinia) are compared using a detailed sedimentological and taphonomic analysis along with functional morphological considerations. The assemblages differ widely with respect to taxonomic composition, sedimentological features, and taphonomic signatures, such as the orientation and degree of abrasion, encrustation, and bioerosion. The first assemblage (Ardara) is characterized by a low-diversity echinoid fauna, consisting exclusively of the two clypeasteroid genera, Amphiope and different morphotypes of Clypeaster. This deposit represents a proximal tempestite originating in a high-energy, shallow-water, shoreface setting. Higher diversity characterizes the second assemblage (Ittiri) with clypeasteroid, spatangoid, and cassiduloid echinoids. This deposit originated by multiple in situ reworking events within a deeper, low-energy, sublittoral environment. The difference in faunal diversity between these assemblages reflects ecological factors such as substrate characteristics and food supply. Differences in preservation potential of the different echinoid tests also influence their representation within the deposits. These described echinoid deposits represent two examples of a wide spectrum of clypeasteroid-dominated assemblages from the Miocene of Sardinia, which are compared with respect to taxonomic makeup, sedimentological and taphonomic features, and depositional environments.

Our material comprises calcified cordaitaleans and tree-fern axes, preserved in braided channel deposits, and interpreted as remains of subhumid riparian vegetation distinct from that of coeval coal swamps. The first plant-arthropod association, attributed to herbivorous insects, comprises cambial damage to cordaitalean leafy branches, resulting in traumatic wound response. The second and most widespread association, attributable to detritivorous oribatid mites, includes tunnels and galleries containing widely scattered, clustered, or densely packed microcoprolites within the inner root mantle of marattialean tree ferns and cordaitalean trunks and branches. Diameter data for tunnels and microcoprolites are multimodal, recording four or five instars of oribatid mites that parallel instar-based fecal pellet and body lengths in modern taxa. The third association attributed, possibly, to an arthropleurid, comprises a single, very large (19 3 14 mm) coprolite. Included plant fragments support a previous conjecture that arborescent lycopsids formed part of this iconic arthropod's diet. Mucus-lined burrows within the macrocoprolite imply that fecal material was processed by annelids. The high diversity and frequency of plant-arthropod associations are unusual for Mid-Pennsylvanian time, and may reflect previously undetected interactions in those ecosystems that lay outside ""coal forest swamps.""

The genus is recorded in paleofloras from Australia, India, South Africa, Brazil, and Argentina, and occurs from the latest Mississippian to the early Permian. Here, we report and analyze the first record of plant-insect interactions found in the Botrychiopsis-type leaves from the basinal deposits of Permian Argentina and Brazil. The samples are from three different Permian deposits: Arroyo Totoral, Bajo de Véliz (Argentina), and Morro do Papaléo (Brazil). Evidence of insect-plant interactions was present in only eight of 154 specimens analyzed. We found evidence of margin and hole feeding damage made by insects. This represents the first evidence of plant-insect interactions in Botrychiopsis leaves from Permian Gondwanan deposits. The occurrence of herbivory only on the Permian species B. plantiana may indicate that consumption of these leaves began during this interval, not in the Carboniferous, as occurred with Cordaites leaves. © 2015, SEPM (Society for Sedimentary Geology).",,coniferous tree; feeding; fern; Gondwana; herbivory; leaf; Mississippian; new record; paleobotany; Permian; pest damage; plant-insect interaction; Argentina; Australia; Brazil; India; South Africa; Hexapoda,,,,,,,"Adami-Rodrigues, K., Iannuzzi, R., Pinto, I.D., Permian plant-insect interaction from a Gondwana flora of southern Brazil (2004) Fossils and Strata, 51, pp. 106-125; Adami-Rodrigues, K., Souza, P.A., Iannuzzi, R., Pinto, I.D., Herbivoria em floras Gonduânicas do Neopaleozó ico do Rio Grande do Sul: análise quantitative (2004) Revista Brasileira de Paleontologia, 7, pp. 93-102; Anderson, J.M., Anderson, H.M., (1985) Paleoflora of Southern Africa.

These assemblages are among very few of Danian age from the entire Southern Hemisphere and thus provide critical data about geographic variation in recovery from the end-Cretaceous extinction. Understanding the depositional context of the Salamanca floras is necessary for comparison with other assemblages and for interpreting their exceptional preservation. The Salamanca Formation was deposited above a widespread erosional sequence boundary (SB-1) resulting from a relative base level rise and widespread marine transgression during the early Danian (Chron C29n). In response to this increase in accommodation space, a broad, shallow estuary formed that most likely extended westward at least as far as the San Bernardo belt. A transgressive systems tract was deposited in this estuary, consisting of bioturbated sand fining upwards to silt. The maximum marine flooding surface at the beginning of the highstand systems tract is defined by well laminated, unburrowed, clay deposits of a low energy, deep shelf. The Salamanca highstand systems tract (HST) consists of sandy and silty facies capped by accreting subtidal bars and sandy shoals containing an abundance of tidal indicators, suggesting deposition proximal to the San Jorge paleo-estuary head. A second sequence boundary (SB-2), formed during Chron C28r and early C28n, separates the older highstand deposits from younger lowstand and transgressive deposits. These consist of estuarine sand shoals, trough cross-bedded sands deposited in aggrading, fluvially influenced tidal channels, tidal flat muds, and bayhead deltas. The best preservation of compression floras and petrified trees occurred near the tops of subtidal bars below SB-2; at the end of the shallowing-upward cycle that caps the second HST; and in fluvially-influenced tidal channels, tidal flat mudstones, and bayhead deltas of the lowstand and transgressive systems tracts that lie above SB-2. These settings were proximal to the source forests and had rapid rates of burial. We interpret the dark muds of the Banco Negro Inferior, which cap the Salamanca Formation, as a late transgressive and highstand systems tract deposited during a time of rising groundwater table and declining river slopes in a widespread, lowland coastal forest.

Dairy Ashford, Houston, TX, United States; Henderson, C.M., Department of Geoscience, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada","A widespread marine microbialite and underlying truncation surface occur in Permian-Triassic sections of South China. We interpret the microbialite to have formed as a shallow, open-marine benthic framework stimulated by high seawater CaCO3 saturation. The widespread distribution across platform interiors and lack of asymmetry or thickening toward platform margins is incompatible with an alternative hypothesis, that microbialite deposition was stimulated by upwelling anoxic, alkaline waters. The truncation surface beneath the microbialite is irregular with overhangs and small caverns extending up to 30 cm beneath the surface indicating a dissolutional origin. Petrographic observations refute the interpretation that strata immediately beneath the surface contain pendant cements, meniscus cements, and vadose silt. Measurements of the anisopachous fibrous cements show that thickened areas have random, not downward orientations. Pores retain the pointed geometry consistent with isopachous cement. Carbon and oxygen isotope measurements, from immediately beneath the surface, do not show a negative shift as would be expected with subaerial exposure. Also incompatible with a subaerial origin is the occurrence of only one truncation surface within a subtidal succession , 50 m thick below the surface and the limited vertical penetration of dissolution. The surface closely resembles a hardground containing a micritized alteration zone with stromatolites encrusted on the surface. We interpret the surface to have formed by submarine dissolution driven by a pulse of ocean acidification associated with Siberian Traps eruptions and the end-Permian extinction. After a hiatus of ∼ 30-100 kyr, seafloor dissolution would have brought seawater back to saturation coupled with increased delivery of calcium to the oceans as the result of elevated continental weathering and caused a rebound in carbonate saturation and precipitation of microbialites.

Morphological analysis of Halysis suggests a U-shape skeleton punctually attached to a soft substrate of carbonate sand and silt. The skeletons have a maximum width of 12 mm and consist of laterally branching tubes. The tubes display circular to laterally flattened outlines with a mean diameter ∼125 μm. The tube walls consist of an inner and an outer layer of microcrystalline calcite, and a central layer of imbricated, radially arranged calcite tablets. An affinity of Halysis with extant siphonous calcareous green algae (Bryopsidales, Udoteaceae) is likely. If correct, Halysis represents a case of a green alga that acquired its skeleton de novo in accordance with sea-water chemistry (low genetic control, low-magnesium calcite, Ordovician calcite sea). Halysis carbonate mounds are lowrelief, internally bedded, shallow-water packstone to grainstone banks. Spar-cemented cavities are Halysis-supported shelter cavities (∼ 90%) and depositional cavities (∼ 10%) produced from sediment-laden flows. The mounds formed as part of a shallow-subtidal carbonate ramp dominated by algal-pellet sand sheets. Autocyclic drivers (sand propagation via tides, storms) produced increments of sediment burial followed by episodes of omission and algal growth. These mounds should not be mistaken for ""shallow-water carbonate mudmounds"" nor for algal framework reefs. In terms of facies, texture, biostratinomy and primary porosity, these mounds are considered a miniature version of bryozoan-rich carbonate banks. Twisted and imbricated aggregates of fronds of Halysis produced shelter cavities making up ∼ 5% of the total mound rock volume, thereby reducing accommodation space in sufficient quantity to explain mound formation. A review shows that Halysis presented herein displays the largest and most robust intrageneric growth form compared to occurrences of more basinal settings (Ordovician) as well as much younger carbonate deposits (Silurian to Devonian).

In rare cases, they may also provide information that is not otherwise represented by body fossils in a particular paleoenvironment. Here, we describe a diverse suite of surficial bone modifications preserved on dyrosaurid crocodyliform bones. These new fossils come from extensive Upper Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) bone and coprolite-dominated phosphate conglomerates from deposits of the Trans-Saharan Seaway in northern Mali. Five specimens have bite traces indicative of feeding by at least two species of neoselachian sharks. Features of some traces suggest they were not made in a fatal attack, but after the dyrosaurids had died, and therefore represent instances of scavenging. Other traces may be attributed to predation or early scavenging. In addition to the shark bite traces, one specimen bears minute, crescent-shaped traces that we tentatively attribute to invertebrate activity. Importantly, the traces described here document the presence of species for which body fossils have not yet been discovered.

Several factors combine to explain their poor fossil record, including rare exposures in a lushly vegetated terrane, dominance of inconspicuous encrusting species, and the adverse effects of diagenesis on fossil preservation. A large collection of samples from the Kutai Basin (East Kalimantan) has allowed new insights into the diversity of Miocene bryozoans in this region. The bryozoan assemblage as a whole consists of 123 species; a remarkable increase in known diversity. Substrate availability appears to be the main factor controlling bryozoan distribution. The majority of encrusting species are associated with plate-like scleractinian corals. Collecting curves allow sampled sites to be divided into three groups characterized by high, medium, and low species richness. The site of highest diversity is a mesophotic reef slope, an environment influenced by high input of terrigenous sediment. Ordination plots show no clear patterns of distribution among sites, with putatively endemic species accounting for most of the discrimination. A similar level of endemism and habitat heterogeneity characterizes modern, tropical bryozoan faunas. However, many more intermediate sites need to be sampled to achieve a fuller understanding of the true pattern of bryozoan species distribution in the Miocene of the Kutai Basin.",,bryozoan; coral reef; endemic species; fossil record; heterogeneity; Miocene; population distribution; species diversity; species richness; substrate; terrain; Borneo; Indonesia; Kutei Basin; Makassar Strait; Anthozoa; Bryozoa; Scleractinia,,,,,,,"Berning, B., The cheilostome bryozoan fauna from the late Miocene of Niebla (Guadalquivir Basin, SW Spain): Environmental and biogeographic implications (2006) Mitteilungen Aus Dem Geologisch-Paläontologischen Institut der Universität Hamburg, 90, pp. 7-156; Best, M.A., Thorpe, J.P., The effect of suspended particulate matter (silt) on the feeding activity of the intertidal ctenostomate bryozoan Flustrellidra hispida (Fabricius) (1996) Bryozoans in Space and Time, pp. 39-45. , Gordon, D.P., Smith, A.M., and Grant-Mackie, J.A., eds Wellington, New Zealand, National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA); Bouchet, P., Lozouet, P., Maestrati, P., Heros, V., Assessing the magnitude of species richness in tropical marine environments: Exceptionally high numbers of molluscs at a New Caledonia site (2002) Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 75, pp. 421-436; Braga, G., Occurrence of Cenozoic Bryozoa in Nanggulan and elsewhere in the Indonesian Archipelago (2001) Memorie di Scienze Geologiche, Padova, 53, pp. 61-64; Cheetham, A.H., Jackson, J.B.C., Sanner, J., Ventocilla, Y., Neogene cheilostome bryozoa of tropical America: Comparison and contrast between the Central American isthmus (panama, Costa Rica) and the north-central Caribbean (Dominican Republic) (1999) A Paleobiotic Survey of Caribbean Faunas from the Neogene of the Isthmus of Panama: Bulletins of American Paleontology, 357, pp. 159-192. , Collins, L.S., and Coates, A.G., eds; Cloke, I.R., Moss, S.J., Craig, J., Structural controls on the evolution of the Kutai Basin, East Kalimantan (1999) Journal of Asian Earth Sciences, 17, pp. 137-156; Cook, P.L., The potential of minute bryozoan colonies in the analysis of deep sea sediments (1981) Cahiers de Biologie Marine, 22, pp. 89-106; Cook, P.L., Chimonides, P.J., Morphology and systematics of some rooted cheilostome Bryozoa (1981) Journal of Natural History, 15, pp. 97-134; Di Martino, E., Taylor, P.D., Systematics and life history of Antoniettella exigua, a new genus and species of cribrimorph bryozoan from the Miocene of East Kalimantan (Indonesia) (2012) Bollettino della Società Paleontologica Italiana, 51, pp. 99-108; Di Martino, E., Taylor, P.D., Miocene bryozoa from east Kalimantan, Indonesia.

Box 9517, Leiden, Netherlands","Two late Miocene Tridacna (giant clam) shells from East Kalimantan (Indonesia) were investigated in order to evaluate their potential as subannually resolved paleoenvironmental archives. Via a combination of X-ray diffraction (XRD), laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS) trace element analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and cathodoluminescence (CL) imaging, pristine versus diagenetically altered domains within the shells were identified. LA-ICPMS transects targeting altered aragonite and calcite zones reveal distinct compositional differences in elemental ratios (B/Ca, Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca/ Ba/Ca, Mn/Ca, Al/Ca, La/Ca, Ce/Ca) relative to primary shell aragonite. Pristine shell domains are characterized by an intact banding pattern of alternating dark and light growth bands, with which spatially resolved LA-ICPMS element/Ca and micromilled δ18O records were aligned. Light δ18O values correspond to dark growth bands, indicating growth during warm seasons. The Mg/Ca and/or Sr/Ca ratios covary with oscillating stable oxygen isotope profiles. Progressive increase in Mg/Ca with age demonstrates that besides temperature, growth kinetics exert control over Mg incorporation. If interpreted as temperature controlled only, δ18O from both shells represents average seasonal sea-surface temperature (SST) variability of 2.7 ± 2.1 and 4.6 ± 1.7 °C, respectively. Using published temperature equations and assuming δ18Osw = -0.88%, corresponding mean annual paleo-sea-surface temperatures of 27.8 ± 0.2 and 28.5 ± 0.2 °C are estimated. Although the fossil Tridacna shells were noticeably affected by alteration on their external surfaces, their internal aragonitic structure is, to a large extent, well preserved. These corresponding paleoproxy records provide detailed insight into tropical SST variability of the Indo-Pacific region during the late Miocene.",,aragonite; bivalve; calcite; decadal variation; fossil record;

To fill this knowledge gap, CCA from early and middle Miocene reefs and related carbonates in the Kutai Basin in East Kalimantan (Borneo, Indonesia) have been studied. The Kutai Basin was dominated by siliciclastic sediments of the proto-Mahakam Delta. Locally, carbonate buildups occur lateral to, or within, the deltaic succession. CCA in the Kutai Basin occur in carbonate beds that were deposited in a low-energy shallow-water platform setting and in association with coral reefs, encrusting the corals or bioclasts. Two main CCA assemblages are recognized herein: (1) a shallow-water assemblage (Sassemblage), dominated by Neogoniolithon spp., thick crusts of Spongites spp., and Hydrolithon spp.; and (2) the Dassemblage, which consists mainly of thin crusts of Lithothamnion spp., Mesophyllum spp., and Sporolithon spp., and is interpreted to have developed in darker waters. Light reduction in reefs in the proto-Mahakam Delta is interpreted to reflect either increased water depth or higher turbidity resulting from higher siliciclastic input. Assemblages with intermediate composition (I-assemblages) also occur. Common CCA with large cell fusions and groups of heterocysts, typical features of modern reef CCA, in the S-assemblages in the middle Miocene of East Kalimantan reflect the initiation of the reef-building CCA flora in the Indo-Pacific region. The occurrence of this kind of CCA confirms the biogeographic differentiation of a tropical reef flora.",,biodiversity; biogeography; carbonate; coral reef; coralline alga; crust; cyst; Miocene; turbidity; Borneo; East Kalimantan; Indonesia; Kutei Basin; Mahakam Delta; Makassar Strait; algae; Anthozoa; Hydrolithon; Lithothamnion; Mesophyllum; Neogoniolithon; Spongites; Sporolithon,,,,,,,"Abbey, E., Webster, J.M., Braga, J.C., Sugihara, K., Wallace, C., Iryu, Y., Potts, D., Seard, C., Variation in deglacial coralgal assemblages and their paleoenvironmental significance: IODP Expedition 310, ""tahiti Sea Level"" (2011) Global and Planetary Change, 76, pp. 1-15; Adey, W.H., Crustose coralline algae as microenvironmental indicators in the Tertiary (1979) Historical Biogeography, Plate Tectonics and the Changing Environment: Oregon University Press, pp. 459-464. , Gray, J., and Boucot, A.J., eds.

In this study, we reconstruct the biodiversity and paleoenvironments on one of these delta-front, mixed carbonatesiliciclastic systems that developed at the Serravallian-Tortonian boundary near the city of Samarinda. In two newly exposed sections, we analyzed the sedimentology and distribution of the main fossil biota including corals, foraminifers, coralline algae, and bryozoans. Seven facies are herein defined, including two dominated by platy corals and two by larger benthic foraminifera. Facies distributions were driven by changes in depth and variations in terrigenous input within a range of delta-front habitats. Despite the turbid conditions, fossil assemblages are highly diverse, including 69 coral species and 28 bryozoan species that occur in coral-dominated facies. Crustose coralline algae were mainly associated with the coral-dominated facies. Larger benthic foraminifera showed broader ecological tolerance within the range represented in the studied sections and thus are common in most facies. These diverse patch reef ecosystems were able to cope with high siliciclastic input during the early development of the Miocene coral reef biota.",,biodiversity; bryozoan; coral reef; coralline alga; facies; foraminifera; fossil record; habitat type; paleoenvironment; population distribution; Tortonian; turbidity; Borneo; East Kalimantan; Indonesia; Kutei Basin; Mahakam Delta; Makassar Strait; algae; Anthozoa; Bryozoa; Foraminifera,,,,,,,"Adey, W.H., Coralline algae as indicators of sea-level (1986) Sea-Level Research: A Manual for the Collection and Evaluation of Data: Amsterdam, pp. 229-279. , Plassche, O. van de, ed, Free University of Amsterdam; Allen, G.P., Chambers, J.L.C., (1998) Sedimentation in the Modern and Miocene Mahakam Delta, 236p. , Jakarta, Indonesia, Indonesian Petroleum Association; Anthony, K.R.N., Coral suspension feeding on fine particulate matter (1999) Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology, 232, pp. 85-106; Bassi, D., Nebelsick, J.H., Components, facies and ramps: Redefining upper Oligocene shallow water carbonates using coralline red algae and larger foraminifera (Venetian area, northeast Italy) (2010) Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, 295, pp. 258-280; Bayer, F.M., Macintyre, I.G., The mineral component of the axis and holdfast of some gorgonacean octocorals (Coelenterata: Anthozoa), with special reference to the family Gorgoniidae (2001) Biological Society of Washington, Proceedings, 114, pp. 309-345; Beesley, P.L., Ross, G.J.B., Wells, A.E., (1998) Mollusca: The Southern Synthesis.

Here, we use paired analyses of thin sections and acid-extracted silicified specimens from the same samples to examine the biases introduced during silicification of Lower Triassic Virgin Limestone carbonates preserved in the Muddy Mountains of southern Nevada. Bivalves dominate most thin sections in the point count data, but rarely silicify completely enough to be recognized in residue. Echinoderms and gastropods are less abundant in thin section but dominate the residues. The abundances of these groups in thin section and residue are only weakly correlated. These findings suggest that although silicification generally captures relative trends in proportional abundance of higher taxa among samples, the silicification process can be taxonomically biased. Given the biases that can occur during silicification, it should not be assumed that silicified collections present a pristine picture of taxonomic or paleoecologic composition. Petrographic analysis has the potential to illuminate the reliability of paleontological data based on silicified collections. © 2015, SEPM (Society for Sedimentary Geology).",,abundance; bivalve; echinoderm; fossil assemblage; fossilization; gastropod; limestone; paleoecology; petrography; silicification; taphonomy; Triassic; Muddy Mountains; Nevada; United States; Bivalvia; Echinodermata; Gastropoda,,,,,,,"Alkahane, H., Furuno, T., Miyjima, H., Yoshikawa, T., Yamamoto, S., Rapid wood silicification in hot spring water: An explanation of silicification of wood during the Earth's history (2004) Sedimentary Geology, 169, pp. 219-228; Beachamp, B., Baud, A., Growth and demise of Permian biogenic chert along northwest Pangea: Evidence for end-Permian collapse of thermohaline circulation (2002) Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, 184, pp. 37-63; Boyd, D.W., Newell, N.D., A reappraisal of Trigoniacean Families (Bivalvia) and a description of two new Early Triassic species (1997) American Museum Novitates, 3216, pp. 1-14; Brayard, A., Vennin, E., Olivier, N., Bylund, K.G., Jenks, J., Stephen, D.A., Bucher, H., Escarguel, G., Transient metazoan reefs in the aftermath of the end-Permian mass extinction (2011) Nature Geosciences, 4, pp. 693-697; Butts, S.H., Silicification (2014) Reading and Writing of the Fossil Record: Preservational Pathways to Exceptional Fossilization, 20, pp. 15-33. , La Flamme, M., Schiffbauer, J.D., and Darroch, S.A.F., eds.: Paleontological Society Short Course; Butts, S.H., Briggs, D.E., Silicification through time (2010) Taphonomy: Process and Bias Through Time, pp. 411-434. , Allison, P. and Bottjer, D.J., eds.

We documented eight Agassiz's desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) nests and ten loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) nests. Gopherus agassizii excavated burrows up to 70 cm long and laid rigid-shelled eggs 10-12 cm below the burrow floor. The 19 cm × 12 cm depressions consisted of hard consolidated sand surrounded by a 3-4-cm-high rim and contained 2-5 hatched eggs in a single layer. These hatched egg bottoms represent ∼ 25% of the original egg, and five of 27 contained fully developed dead neonates. Desiccated membrane separated from the egg interior forming pockets that filled with eggshell and sand. Of 106 and 79 eggshell fragments in the hatched egg and surrounding sand, 48% and 23% occurred concave up, respectively. However, the combined numbers of eggshell fragments inside the eggs and in the immediately surrounding sand approximates the 60:40 ratios at in situ avian nests. Therefore, this ratio may provide reliable evidence for hatching sites regardless of the incubation strategy employed by the adult. Caretta caretta nests differed from those of tortoises in their greater depth (∼ 50 cm) and occurrence in moist, cohesive sand. Clutches contained over 100 pliable-shelled eggs that tore and collapsed upon hatching, without brittle fracture. Failed eggs in two clutches showed five development stages, indicating that the deaths occurred over an extended time period. With the exception of predation, the G. agassizii and C. caretta nests showed no significant eggshell or hatched eggs above the egg chamber.

The Central Indonesian Kutai Basin is typical of many Cenozoic Southeast Asian basins in having extensive and varied carbonate systems, and is one of the few regions in the Coral Triangle with detailed systematic multitaxon evaluation of Oligo-Miocene deposits. The Kutai Basin may therefore provide data, when compared with other modern and global datasets, to better understand marine biodiversity development within the global diversity foci. Carbonate systems in the Kutai Basin included small-scale ephemeral features, such as delta-associated patch reefs, mixed carbonate-clastic shelves, and large-scale (. 10 km) land-attached and isolated carbonate platforms affected by varied energy regimes. Twenty-five-plus subenvironments or habitats are spread across the different carbonate systems, with the large-scale platforms hosting over 12- 15 different habitats. These subenvironments include clastic-influenced mesophotic coral reefs/carpets, nonclastic- and clasticinfluenced sea-grass beds, downslope reworked coral rubble, and shallow low-energy inner platform areas, to name a few. Perhaps paradoxically, the systems that two decades ago were almost unstudied, the clastic-influenced coral reefs/carpets, are now the only ones in the region to have been systematically studied for their marine biota. Detailed biotic studies have therefore only investigated , 4 of the 25-plus potentially habitable carbonate subenvironments within the basin. This variability of carbonate systems and their subenvironments, but paucity of detailed biotic data is typical of many basins within equatorial Southeast Asia. It is recognized that detailed multitaxon biotic studies are in their infancy for Southeast Asia, and that there are challenges of taxonomic bias and/or preservation for many groups within the fossil record. Currently, however, we cannot evaluate marine biodiversity partitioning across the varied habitat mosaics of Southeast Asian carbonate systems with possible pathways discussed for furthering this field of research. It is likely that we are (?grossly) underestimating biodiversity on a basin-wide and probably a system-wide scale. It is hoped that studies of this type will contribute towards better understanding of equatorial marine carbonate systems, their biological inhabitants and producers, and the spatio-temporal development of global biodiversity hotspots.",,biodiversity;

We evaluate how well the death assemblage (DA) reflects the original living community and whether there was a recent ecological shift in species composition. Quantitative analysis of 18 samples from unvegetated sandy substrata shows that dead individuals dominate in the shallow subtidal lagoon, but living and dead individuals were roughly equally abundant on the tidal flat. This difference points to rapid degradation or export of dead shells from tidal flats, leading to smaller potential for time averaging. Rarefied species richness and diversity of DAs is higher than that of the living assemblages (LAs) at the scale of habitats and at the scale of the study area, and this difference in richness is stronger and live-dead (LD) agreement in composition is smaller in the subtidal than in the intertidal habitats. Distinct assemblages characterized intertidal and subtidal habitats both in LAs and DAs, and the rank-abundance distributions of DAs generally corresponded to that of LAs. We suggest that anthropogenic impact in the area did not result in a major environmental change in the subtidal environment during the past few decades because existing small differences between LAs and DAs can be explained by some degree of time averaging and small-scale redistribution of shells. On the tidal flat, however, the lower time-averaging of the DA and the generalistic life habits of prominent members in the LA do not exclude a major shift.

Here we present a detailed taphonomic analysis of the first large-scale Centrosaurus apertus bonebed (McPheeters bonebed) from the Oldman Formation of southeastern Alberta. The McPheeters bonebed rivals the richest bonebeds in the Dinosaur Park Formation in terms of bone density and size, and the complete disarticulation of elements. The bonebed occurs in an overbank facies and is dominated by small bone clasts, suggesting that only low energy water current contributed to the formation of the bonebed before its final burial event. Patterns of taphonomic modification suggest that bones experienced little weathering, breakage, or scavenging. In turn, these conclusions are compatible with an overall interpretation of rapid burial in humid conditions after the disarticulation of elements. These taphonomic features are virtually identical to those seen in the well-documented bonebeds of this species in the Dinosaur Park Formation, which are interpreted to represent mass death events caused by seasonal tropical storms and associated large-scale flooding. Late Cretaceous dinosaur species typically have small geographic and stratigraphic ranges defined by the extent of single geological formations. The new bonebed extends the distribution of Centrosaurus apertus to the upper Oldman Formation, which is interpreted as more inland than the coastally influenced Dinosaur Park Formation, and suggests that mass death events related to seasonal tropical storms occurred over a broader geographic area and in a greater range of paleoenvironments than previously documented.

Even though coral-associated aragonitic faunas are rarely well preserved, the composition of the assemblage described here can be used to address the following questions: (1) How do the mollusk assemblages in coral habitats differ from other habitats, and (2) What is the effect of sampling on estimates of taxon richness? The mollusk assemblage is dominated by predatory snails and includes typical modern coral-associated taxa such as the gastropod Coralliophila and the bivalve Tridacna. Our investigation implies that adequate documentation of Cenozoic mollusk diversity in the Indo-Pacific is even more challenging than previously expected as very large samples are required to capture species richness. Further assessments of fossil faunas from coral-dominated habitats will be required to provide insight to development of Indo-Pacific biodiversity through time.",,biodiversity; bivalve; coral reef; gastropod; habitat type; paleoecology; species diversity; species richness; taxonomy; Tortonian; East Kalimantan; Indonesia; Anthozoa; Bivalvia; Coralliophila; Gastropoda; Mollusca; Tridacna,,,,,,,"Allen, G.P., Chambers, J.L.C., Sedimentation in the modern and miocene mahakam delta (1998) Indonesian Petroleum Association, Jakarta, Indonesia, 236p; Beesley, P.L., Ross, G.J.B., Wells, A.E., Mollusca: The southern synthesis: Fauna of Australia.

Urban development around the city of Samarinda has produced over four kilometers of well-exposed stratigraphy depicting the progradation of the ancient Mahakam river delta across the Samarinda area, which includes slope, shelf, and deltaic deposits (clastic and carbonate). Previous studies have preliminarily dated the succession as middle Miocene, but reworking and the scarcity of diagnostic fossils make dating difficult. In this paper, an integrated stratigraphic age model has been constructed for the middle Miocene of the Samarinda region with a combination of magnetostratigraphy, sequence stratigraphy, and biostratigraphy (nannofossil, planktonic foraminifera, and larger benthic foraminifera). This age model provides improved temporal constraints for part of the Mahakam Delta succession. It also helps to place the pattern of biodiversity changes seen in Indonesian reef communities into a better time perspective, and permits more accurate sedimentation rates to be determined. It may also serve as a reference point to compare other Neogene sections in Southeast Asia. The two reef complexes at Samarinda, the Batu Putih and the Stadion section, are magnetostratigraphically dated at ∼ 15 Ma and 11.6 Ma, respectively. The new chronology for the Samarinda succession shows that the Mahakam Delta went through a major phase of buildout and progradation during the middle and earliest late Miocene, during which time progradation across the former shelf break took place in the Samarinda area.",,chronology; dating method; foraminifera; fossil record; Miocene; nanofossil; paleontology; sedimentation rate; stratigraphy; succession; urban development; Borneo; East Kalimantan; Indonesia; Mahakam Delta; Foraminifera,,,,,,,"Adams, C.G., A reconsideration of the east indian letter classification of the tertiary: British museum (natural history) bulletin (1970) Geology, 19, pp. 1-137; Adams, C.G., Neogene larger foraminifera, evolutionary and geological events in the context of datum planes (1984) Pacific Neogene Datum Planes, pp. 47-67. , Ikebe, N., and Tsuchi, R., eds.

As one of the characteristically common Early Triassic carbonate sediments, ooids provide a potential proxy to refine understanding of the biotic and environmental stresses during this time through analysis of their formation and size variations. A case study from South China and a global review are presented herein to explore the interrelations between occurrences of oolites and ooid size variations with biotic and environmental changes. Correlations between oolites and various biotic and environmental changes suggest a strong correspondence with episodes of euxinia/dysoxia but less so with skeleton abundance and temperature changes, implying complex interactions between multiple biotic and environmental anomalies in the aftermath of the P-Tr extinction. The episodic occurrence pattern of oolites from the end-Permian through the Early Triassic coincides with the multiple crises of the P-Tr mass extinction and its aftermath. The global increase in size of ooids during the early stage of the P-Tr mass extinction aftermath indicates the most severe and extensive conditions of devastation for ecosystems. The single occurrence of giant ooids in the Nanpanjiang Basin within the Olenekian implies local higher ecosystem stress than other areas. This analysis of ooid size variations and the paleoceanographic implications suggests that the size of ooids could be an appropriate quantified sedimentary proxy for ecosystem devastation with varied temporal and spatial ranges.

Here, we evaluate the fidelity between living intertidal mussel bed communities (life assemblages or LAs) and mollusk shell accumulations (death assemblages or DAs) from the environmentally harsh Patagonian Atlantic Coast. LAs were sampled from rocky mid-intertidal and mussel-dominated habitats while DAs were collected from the high water mark at beaches in close proximity to the living intertidal community to assess live-dead mismatch at regional scales. DAs were restricted to the subset of species in the DAs that inhabit rocky intertidal habitats. A total of 37,193 mollusk specimens from 15 intertidal species were included in the analysis. Ten species were present in LAs, 14 in DAs, and nine were shared by LAs and DAs. DAs showed higher diversity, less dominance, and more rare species than LAs. Despite finding good agreement in species composition between DAs and LAs within the same region, smaller species are underrepresented, as shown by differences in size-frequency distributions. Our findings indicate that the composition of DAs is a result of the combined effects of spatial and temporal averaging, size-related biases, and biases related to low detectability of boring and vagile species in LAs. Thus, DAs do not accurately detect within-provincial latitudinal gradients in composition. However, DAs clearly capture differences between the Argentine-Magellanic Transition Zone and the Magellanic Province, indicating that DAs are informative tools at regional scales despite the environmental harshness to which they are subjected. © 2015, SEPM (Society for Sedimentary Geology).",,beach; bivalve; dominance; fossil assemblage; latitudinal gradient; paleobiology; paleoecology; rare species; regional geography; rocky shore; shell; size distribution; spatiotemporal analysis; species diversity; Atlantic Coast [South America]; Magellan Region; Patagonia,,,,,,,"Adami, M.L., Efectos de la herbivoría de la lapa Siphonaria lessoni Blainville 1924 (Gastropoda) sobre la comunidad asociada a Brachidontes rodriguezii (d'Orbigny 1846) (Bivalvia) (2008) Revista Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales, 10 (2), pp. 309-317; Adami, M.L., Tablado, A., López Gappa, J.J., Spatial and temporal variability in intertidal assemblages dominated by the mussel Brachidontes rodriguezii (d'Orbigny 1846) (2004) Hydrobiologia, 520, pp. 49-59; Adami, M.L., Tablado, A., Sodor, M.A., Population dynamics of the intertidal mytilid Brachidontes rodriguezii (Bivalvia) on a rocky shore (2008) Thalassas, 24, pp. 19-25; Adami, M., Pastorino, G., Orensanz, J.M., Phenotypic differentiation of ecologically significant Brachidontes species co-occurring in intertidal mussel beds from the southwestern Atlantic (2013) Malacologia, 56, pp. 59-67; Albano, P.G., Sabelli, B., Comparison between death and living mollusks assemblages in a Mediterranean infralittoral off-shore reef (2011) Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, 310, pp. 206-215; Aldea, C., Troncoso, J.S., Remarks on the genus trophon (s.l.) montfort 1810 (Mollusca: Gastropoda: Muricidae) in the southern ocean and adjacent areas (2010) Thalassas, 26, pp. 47-73; Arribas, L.P., Bagur, M., Klein, E., Penchaszadeh, P.E., Palomo, M.G., Geographic distribution of two mussel species and associated assemblages along the northern Argentinean coast (2013) Aquatic Biology, 18, pp. 91-103; Balech, E., Ehrlich, M.D., Esquema biogeográfico del mar Argentino (2008) Revista de Investigación y Desarrollo Pesquero, 19, pp. 45-75; Bennington, J.B., Trascending patchiness in the comparative analysis of paleocommunities: A test case from the Upper Cretaceous of New Jersey (2003) PALAIOS, 18, pp. 22-33; Bernard, F.R., Catalogue of the living Bivalvia of the eastern Pacific Ocean: Bering Strait to Cape Horn (1983) Canadian Special Publication of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, 61, pp. 1-102; Bertness, M.D., Crain, C.M., Silliman, B.R., Bazterrica, M.C., Reyna, M.V., Hidalgo, F., Farina, J.K., The communities structure of western Atlantic Patagonian Rocky Shores (2006) Ecological Monographs, 76, pp. 439-460; Bigatti, G., Marzinelli, E.M., Penchaszadeh, P.E., Seasonal reproduction and sexual maturity in Odontocymbiola magellanica (Neogastropoda, Volutidae) (2008) Invertebrate Biology, 127 (3), pp. 314-326; Boretto, G., Gordillo, S., Colombo, F., Cioccale, M., Fucks, E.E., Multiproxy evidence of late Quaternary environmental changes in the coastal area of Puerto Lobos (northern Patagonia, Argentina) (2013) Quaternary International, 305, pp. 188-205; Camacho, H., Descripción geoló gica de la hoja 47h-48g, Bahía Camarones.

These eggs immediately overlie the lower surface of a 35-cm-long × 7-cm-thick, dark-green mudstone lens, surrounded by reddish-purple mudstone. The long axes of three eggs are parallel to one another and to the lower boundary of the lens, whereas the fourth egg lies at a 30 ° angle to the others. A thin, 1-cm-thick organic horizon overlies the eggs, suggesting they were buried with some vegetation. Geometric modeling of the slightly asymmetrical C. canadensis eggs yields a volume and mass of approximately 194 cm 3 and 205 g for each egg. This method provides a more accurate estimation for the surface area than allometric equations that are based on modern bird eggs because of the elongate shape of many nonavian theropod eggs. Pore density and water vapor conductance (G<inf>H2O</inf>) calculated from one egg in the trace and five additional C. canadensis eggs from the Willow Creek anticline vary across three regions. High, moderate, and very low G<inf>H2O</inf> characterize the equatorial zone, blunt, and tapering poles, respectively. The average G<inf>H2O</inf> for all eggs exceeds that of an avian egg of similar mass by 3.93, thus supporting sedimentologic evidence of substrate burial during incubation.

Analysis of triplicate grid samples from six shell beds in southern Utah shows that the reclining valves of the oyster are disproportionately represented by the inflated left valve, eight times more often than the smaller, flat right valve, and whole valves are rare. The shells nearly always fragment from the commissure toward the thick umbonal half of the shell. These fragmented shells make up more than half of grid samples, and only 0.5% contain predatory drillholes. By contrast, complete shells are drilled nearly 5% of the time, particularly near the umbo. Fragmentation cannot account for this discrepancy because the preponderance of drillholes occurs in the umbonal part of the shell, the part that is always preserved. To understand this paradox, drilled Pycnodonte were collected from a separate site in Utah and drillhole position on the shell was mapped to create a probabilistic model of drillhole sites. Results show that . 60% of drillholes are positioned in the robust part of the umbonal shell, confirming observations in the unfragmented grid-sampled shells. We propose that the deficit in drilled shell fragments can be explained by spatial or temporal mixing of two populations of Pycnodonte that lived under separate predation pressures. Autochthonous shells show greater drillhole incidence and shell completeness, whereas fragmented umbonal shells indicate transportation from a separate environment having lower predation pressure. This study indicates that taphonomic mixing may introduce significant bias in drilling incidence.

The role of permeability was tested in a series of experiments in which cod tissue was decayed in glass beads of varying permeabilities. Decay was measured using infrared gas analysis (IRGA), and mineral precipitation within the beads (a proxy for concretion growth) was measured using micro CT scanning. The interactions of the three variables-sediment permeability, decay, and mineralization-were assessed with MANOVA and with linear regressions of decay and precipitation per unit decay on permeability. These two linear regressions were combined into a more general, nonlinear expression of the relationship between permeability and total mineral precipitation. The results show that sediment permeability has two competing effects on precipitation, the strength of each varying dynamically depending on permeability. Low permeability environments inhibit decay, thus enhancing fossilization but inhibiting overall precipitation because a build-up of decay products is necessary to promote mineral formation (the ''decay effect''). However, low permeability environments can also increase precipitation per unit decay by inhibiting the diffusion of decay products away from the carcass, allowing for a faster build-up of decay products (the ''mineralization effect''). At low permeabilities, the decay effect dominates (decay controlled), and precipitation is positively correlated with permeability. At higher permeabilities, the mineralization effect dominates (permeability controlled), and precipitation is negatively correlated with permeability. The experiments show that fossilization within concretions is promoted by decay inhibition (at low permeabilities) and rapid concretion growth (at intermediate permeabilities). Thus, the effects of permeability on fossilization are complex, and influence the mechanism of fossilization. © 2015, SEPM (Society for Sedimentary Geology).",,cells and cell components; chemical analysis;

The thickest (10-40 cm) and oldest parts of the crust (previously reported as up to 640-830 years old), primarily at mid-photic depths of 15-25 m, are composed of buildups of the genus Clathromorphum. Due to its annual growth increments and cycling of Mg content with temperature, Clathromorphum has recently been developed as a high-resolution climate archive. The age of the archive is primarily limited by the boring of mollusks that reduce structural integrity, remove the record, and induce local diagenesis. Depressions and gentle slopes in the deeper portions of Subarctic rocky bottoms often collect mixed bioclastic and siliciclastic sediments, including a dense cover of rhodoliths (Lithothamnion glaciale and Lithothamnion tophiforme). In this paper we describe a transition zone of these two environments that forms on cobble/boulder glacial erratic bottoms in northern Labrador. Clathromorphum compactum buildups on the boulders and cobbles projecting through rhodolith beds can be preserved by finegrained anaerobic sediments that in turn reduce mollusk boring. This significantly enhances preservation and longevity of C. compactum crusts. We describe specimens of ages up to 1200 years BP, and discuss how greater ages can be obtained for archiving high-resolution climate information.

Box 13189, Folly Beach, SC, United States","A small (3.4 cm) coprolite from the Upper Cretaceous (middle Campanian age) Coachman Formation in South Carolina, contains six cervical vertebrae from a very small, freshwater, trionychid turtle. Four of the vertebrae included in the coprolite are aligned and partly articulated. The coprolite shows typical selachian heteropolar shape with traces of spiral morphology, and is attributed to one of several common lamniform shark taxa in the associated marine fauna, most probably Squalicorax kaupi. Based on the minute size of the included vertebrae, with the largest 4.5 mm long, the turtle must have been very small and likely newly hatched. Assuming the selachian producing the specimen was a marine or estuarine species, this coprolite specimen indicates that the shark was feeding in or proximal to a fluvial environment, as observed in modern species of Carcharhinus. Given the small size of the coprolite, the shark was likely also small, suggesting that a juvenile Late Cretaceous shark was feeding far upstream, perhaps near its pupping area.

We present an updated stratigraphy and revise the taxonomic determinations for important historical collections from Indonesia that have been the basis of our knowledge of the history of the region for the past 150 years. Revision of the stratigraphy increases the resolution of ages assigned to most of the collections, and shifts a significant number of coral occurrences from the Pliocene to the late Miocene revealing a new Pliocene sampling gap. The previously recognized Paleogene sampling gap remains open. Analysis of taxonomic turnover with unrevised and revised data show similar overall patterns, with an early Miocene increase in richness followed by a plateau of relatively high richness. Overall, the observed pattern of taxonomic turnover is highly correlated with sample size, suggesting that uneven sampling may be a more important control on the data pattern than processes of speciation and extinction. Highly correlated turnover patterns of zooxanthellate and azooxanthellate taxa are also consistent with this interpretation. The paucity of Paleogene data in the historical collections means that the prevailing paradigm of Neogene origins of high richness in the modern Coral Triangle remains a tautological default hypothesis. New collections are required to adequately estimate rates of taxonomic turnover in the region, and to reconstruct the structure and functioning of ancient ecosystems during the origins of the Coral Triangle biodiversity hotspot.",,biodiversity; biostratigraphy; coral reef; data set; extinction; Neogene; Paleogene; reconstruction; species diversity; species richness; taxonomy; zooxanthella; Indonesia; Anthozoa,,,,,,,"Adams, C.G., A reconsideration of the East Indian letter classification of the Tertiary (1970) British Museum (Natural History) Geology Bulletin, 19, pp. 1-137; Adams, C.G., Neogene larger foraminifera, evolutionary and geological events in the context of datum planes (1984) Pacific Neogene Datum Planes, pp. 47-67. , Ikebe, N. and Tsuchi, R., eds.

The author describes a rare ichthyosaur carcass-fall community from the Posidonia Shale (lower Toarcian) of Germany, which provides insights into the role played by large marine vertebrates in determining regional benthic ecology during this period. It is demonstrated here that, while more important than previously thought, there is little evidence to suggest that ichthyosaur carcasses played a substantial role in structuring the benthic ecology of the European Toarcian epeiric sea. In general, within the shallow waters of the Posidonia Shale, conditions conducive to the creation of carcass-fall communities were rare, and when present, resulted in localized magnification of background taxa and higher local biodiversity, rather than a unique community of epibiont organisms. The community which developed is ecologically similar to modern whale-fall communities, but differs in important ways, particularly with regard to the presence/absence of the chemosynthetic faunas which are most intensively described in the literature.

The history of biota in the region has been inferred from the present-day biogeography and phylogeny of extant organisms, but these analyses do not provide adequate tests of the various hypotheses proposed for the origins of the diversity hotspot. The papers in this special issue present the results of an interdisciplinary research project designed to reconstruct the history of shallow marine biota and habitats within the hotspot and help understand the ecological context responsible for the maintenance of the diverse regional biota. A series of remarkably complete and fresh exposures were studied from the Kutai Basin (East Kalimantan, Indonesia) that included thick lower to upper Miocene sections of deltaic and marine sediments including abundant and extremely well preserved fossils. New stratigraphic and environmental frameworks allowed comparison of biota from habitats ranging from shelf-edge reefs to nearshore shallow seagrass meadows and coral carpets. Diversity was overall high throughout the interval, especially when compared to diversity in similar modern turbid mixed carbonate-siliciclastic settings. This points to the previously unrecognized importance of these mesophotic habitats for the development of the diverse reef-associated communities in the modern-day hotspot.",,biodiversity; biogeography; biota; coral reef; fossil record; habitat type; hot spot; marine environment; marine sediment; Miocene; phylogeny; seagrass; shelf break; throughflow; turbidity; Borneo; Indonesia; Kalimantan; Kutei Basin; Makassar Strait; Anthozoa,,,,,,,"Bambach, R.K., Species richness in marine benthic habitats through the Phanerozoic (1977) Paleobiology, 3, pp. 152-167; Bellwood, D.R., Hughes, T.P., Regional-scale assembly rules and biodiversity of coral reefs (2001) Science, 292, pp. 1532-1534; Bellwood, D.R., Renema, W., Rosen, B.R., Biodiversity hotspots, evolution and coral reef biogeography: A review (2012) Biotic Evolution and Environmental Change in Southeast Asia: Systematics Association Special, 82, pp. 216-245. , Gower, D.J., Johnson, K.G., Richardson, J.E., Rosen, B.R., Rüber, L., and Williams, S.T., eds, Cambridge University Press; Bouchet, P., Lozouet, P., Maestrati, P., Heros, V., Assessing the magnitude of species richness in tropical marine environments: Exceptionally high numbers of molluscs at a new caledonia site (2002) Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 75, pp. 421-436; Bromfield, K., Neogene corals from the indo-pacific: Indonesia (2013) Papua New Guinea, and Fiji: Bulletins of American Paleontology, 387, pp. 1-130; Collins, L.S., Coates, A.G., Introduction (1999) A Paleobiotic Survey of Caribbean Faunas from the Neogene of the Isthmus of Panama: Bulletins of American Paleontology, 357, pp. 5-13. , Collins, L.S., and Coates, A.G., eds; Crame, J.A., Taxonomic diversity gradients through geological time (2001) Diversity and Distributions, 7, pp. 175-189; Di Martino, E., Taylor, P.D., Johnson, K.G., Bryozoan diversity in the Miocene of the Kutai Basin, East Kalimantan, Indonesia (2015) PALAIOS, 30, pp. 109-115; European Union Community Research And Development Information Service, (2014) Throughflow, , http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/93289_en.html, Checked December 2014; Hall, R., Cottam, M.A., Wilson, M.E.J., The SE Asian gateway: History and tectonics of the Australia-Asia collision (2011) Geological Society, London, Special Publications, 355, pp. 1-6; Hoeksema, B.W., Delineation of the indo-malayan centre of maximum marine biodiversity: The coral triangle (2007) Time, and Place: Distributions, Barriers, and Islands: Dordrecht, pp. 117-178. , Renema, W., ed., Biogeography, Springer; Hughes, T.P., Connolly, S.R., Keith, S.A., Geographic ranges of reef corals (Cnidaria: Anthozoa: Scleractinia) in the Indo-Pacific (2013) Ecology, 94, p. 1659; Huyghe, D., Merle, D., Lartaud, F., Cheype, E., Emmanuel, L., Middle Lutetian climate in the Paris Basin: Implications for a marine hotspot of paleobiodiversity (2012) Facies, 58, pp. 587-604; Jablonski, D., Belanger, C.L., Berke, S.K., Huang, S., Krug, A.Z., Roy, K., Tomasovych, A., Valentine, J.W., Out of the tropics, but how?

Indirect indicators are often needed to discriminate seagrass beds from other shallow marine paleohabitats. Here, the stable isotope signatures of mollusk shells are examined to determine if they might provide such an indicator in addition to the faunal composition of mollusk assemblages. Aragonitic shells of 167 gastropods and bivalves from Burdigalian and Tortonian deposits in Java and East Kalimantan (Indonesia) are analyzed for their δ18O and δ13C ratios. The faunas represent fully marine to brackish water environments and include seagrass meadows (with dispersed corals), mixed seagrass-coral, and coral-dominated habitats (with dispersed seagrass). We assess processes and settings that shape inorganic isotope signals in the Miocene ambient waters and fractionation processes occurring at the time of shell deposition. Depleted δ18O and δ13C ratios are shown in brackish water samples. Furthermore, chemosymbiotic species show depleted δ13C ratios. A significant difference is found between the carbon isotopic signatures of coral- and seagrass-dominated environments within a stratigraphic interval. Seagrass communities consistently yield comparatively enriched δ13C ratios. Hence, stable isotope ratios may provide additional evidence for distinguishing paleoenvironments and are helpful in identifying ecological processes and settings within these environments.",,brackish water; Burdigalian; carbon isotope; community structure; fossil record; habitat type; isotopic ratio; marine environment; mollusc; nutrient cycling; oxygen isotope; paleoecology; paleoenvironment; seagrass; stable isotope; Tortonian; East Kalimantan; Indonesia; Anthozoa; Bivalvia; Gastropoda,,,,,,,"Bandel, K., Operculum shape and construction of some fossil Neritimorpha (Gastropoda) compared to those of modern species of the subclass (2008) Vita Malacologia, 7, pp. 19-36; Batenburg, S.J., Reichert, G.-J., Jilbert, T., Janse, M., Wesselingh, F.P., Renema, W., Interannual climate variability in the Miocene: High resolution trace element and stable isotope ratios in giant clams (2011) Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, 306, pp. 75-81; Beesley, P.L., Ross, G.J.B., Wells, A.E., (1998) Mollusca: The Southern Synthesis.

It possesses a complex gas-liquid combined system to regulate its buoyancy in the water column. After death this system is lost and the shells become either positively or negatively buoyant and float for some time or respectively sink to the seafloor where taphonomic processes strongly influence the shell's condition. A major process in taphonomy is bioerosion. We present herein a detailed study of the influence of taphonomic pathways on bioerosion in backshore collected and deep-water dredged Nautilus shells from the New Caledonia region. Some bioerosion of Nautilus shells may take place during life but most occurs after death and deposition of the shell. The ichnocoenosis found in the shells collected in backshore settings indicates that these shells were positively buoyant after the death of the animals and were initially deposited in a nearshore environment (shallow euphotic zone III to deep euphotic zone) before they were transported ashore. Part of the deep-water dredged shells, in contrast, were initially deposited in the deep euphotic to dysphotic zone before being transported into aphotic depths. We demonstrate that bioerosion supports the reconstruction of taphonomic pathways of Nautilus shells and, following an actualistic approach, it can help to reconstruct taphonomic processes and depositional settings for fossil cephalopod shells.

Affected nests were located on the beach bordering a small marina. Flooding and transport most commonly occurred during very high tides. Nests with eggs, nests without eggs, and eggs without nests were observed floating offshore. Our observations have implications for the interpretation of fossilized amniote nests and eggs, namely that a given fossil nest cannot be assumed a priori to have been preserved in situ without careful consideration of nest structure and lithological features of the preservation site. Also, prior to preservation, a fossil egg or egg clutch may have been transported by a floating nest functioning as a transport vessel, even if at the time of discovery evidence for the nest has disappeared.
